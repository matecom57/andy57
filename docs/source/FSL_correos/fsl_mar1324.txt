Position: Postdoctoral Position in Neuroimaging Research on Brain
Aging and Alzheimer’s disease

Area: Brain Aging and Alzheimer’s disease

Department: Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior

Institution: Brown University

We are seeking a highly motivated postdoctoral researcher to lead an
NIH-funded project in the Laboratory for Cognitive and Translational
Neuroscience (Director: Dr. Hwamee Oh) at Brown University. The
project is to use amyloid and tau PET and structural MRI/DTI to study
the impact of Alzheimer’s disease pathologies on structural and
functional networks among cognitively normal older adults and patients
with cognitive impairment.

Applicants with a Ph.D. degree in cognitive neuroscience,
computational neuroscience, biomedical engineering, or a relevant field
are encouraged to apply. Prior experience with human neuroimaging in
PET and/or structural MRI, and familiarity with programming in relevant
languages (e.g., Python, MATLAB) are required. Applicants with
experience with amyloid and tau PET or diffusion weighted imaging are
especially encouraged to apply. The successful candidate is expected
to demonstrate communication skills, motivation and interest in the
area of neuroscience of cognitive and brain aging and Alzheimer’s
disease, and the ability to independently develop research questions
and work in collaboration with other team members.

A preferred start date is Summer 2024, although it can be flexible. The
position is primarily affiliated with the Department of Psychiatry and
Human Behavior at Brown University.

Interested applicants should email a brief description of research
background and career goals, and CV with a list of 3 references to Dr.
Hwamee Oh at hwamee_oh@brown.edu.

Hello Matthew,

Thanks for your response. 

I am a bit confused by the commands you mentioned. I could not find them in the instructions. Nevertheless, I tried them and received this message:
Error while loading conda entry point: conda-libmamba-solver (dlopen(/usr/local/fsl/lib/python3.11/site-packages/libmambapy/bindings.cpython-311-darwin.so, 0x0002): Library not loaded: @rpath/libarchive.19.dylib

  Referenced from: <494304CB-2F24-3FF8-B4AE-F4E6B16BDC26> /usr/local/fsl/lib/libmamba.2.0.0.dylib

  Reason: tried: '/usr/local/fsl/lib/libarchive.19.dylib' (no such file), '/usr/local/fsl/lib/python3.11/site-packages/libmambapy/../../../libarchive.19.dylib' (no such file), '/usr/local/fsl/lib/python3.11/site-packages/libmambapy/../../../libarchive.19.dylib' (no such file), '/usr/local/fsl/bin/../lib/libarchive.19.dylib' (no such file), '/usr/local/fsl/bin/../lib/libarchive.19.dylib' (no such file), '/usr/local/lib/libarchive.19.dylib' (no such file), '/usr/lib/libarchive.19.dylib' (no such file, not in dyld cache))



CondaValueError: You have chosen a non-default solver backend (libmamba) but it was not recognized. Choose one of: classic


The instructions in the fix package included these instructions.:
. $FSLDIR/fslpython/bin/activate $FSLDIR/fslpython/envs/fslpython

I tried to remove the python part, but ended up with an error that it was not a conda environment, even when I tried to use $FSLDIR/bin/conda-env.

Yes, I am using R2019a with FIX 1.06.15.

What can I try to fix it?

Thanks,

Marie

Hello Marie,
   For FSL 6.0.6 or newer, “fslpython” needs to be removed from the paths in the installation calls, e.g.

$FSLDIR/fslpython/bin/conda create -n fslR

would become:

$FSLDIR/bin/conda create -n fslR

And

$FSLDIR/fslpython/envs/fslR/bin/R

would become

$FSLDIR/envs/fslR/bin/R

For your FSL 6.0.5 install, can you confirm you installed the MCR version that matches the FIX version - R2019a for FIX 1.06.15?

Kind Regards
Matthew



Dear fsl community,

 

I have troubles creating physiological noise regressors recorded by biopack using pnm. 

First, I still have the same trouble with running pnm from the command line as stated in the email below from the archive- the .txt file includes all files in that folder. Please could you confirm if the correct ev_list should be a list only including the ev_0*.nii.gz files created in the process, but not any of the .txt or .html files also in that folder?

Second, the ev_0*.nii.gz files created in the process are quite small (168 bytes) and appear to be all 0s by inspection with fsleyes or nilearn. The textfiles created by pnm_stage1, however, seem reasonable (one column of ascending numbers). Is there some way to check if the evs created by pnm_evs are correct, and if they aren’t do you have an idea of what could be going wrong?

 

This is the command I am using:

 

pnm_evs –tr=1.078 -i ../func/preproc_clean01.feat/prefiltered_func_data.nii.gz -o pnm_out -r sub-23_01_resp.txt -c sub_23_01_card.txt --csfmask=../func/nuisance01/segmentation/CSF_mask.nii.gz


Apologies for cross-posting
 
Dear Colleagues
I am sharing this final call as we will be closing our survey of carers in UK HE at the end of the month. Many thanks to those of you who have replied.
To be eligible, you need to be employed by a UK-based university and to be a carer (broadly understood, including as a parent, for a friend, a relative etc.). Here’s the link:
https://angliaruskin.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/national-carers-survey-uk The outcomes will help us to better understand the experiences of carers in higher education and to provide recommendations to the sector.
We have received ethical approval for this project and are happy to address any question.
Warm wishes

Dear Matthew,
This is the contents of design.trg:
-5.000000e-01 6.752721e+01 1.355544e+02 2.035816e+02 2.716088e+02 106.122440

It is a block-design, visual stimulus (on & off) design. I attach the ev1 (on) design timing here:
0 42 1
50 42 1
100 42 1
150 42 1
200 42 1

thank you!

Best wishes,

Hi Alex,
Can you let me know the contents of “design.trg” in the input feat directory and roughly what sort of design is being used ( especially ev1 )?

Kind Regards

Hi Sean,
                The line:
export PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin:/Users/seantanyongwei/opt/anaconda3/bin:/Users/seantanyongwei/opt/anaconda3/condabin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.9/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/X11/bin

Is probably the one overriding the other settings. If you want to preserve these paths, then adding ${FSLDIR}/share/fsl/bin to the line ( remember all paths are colon separated ) should fix things.

Kind regards
Matthew

Hi Marie,
                The older instructions are here ( that need to have modified paths ):

https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa-jisc.exe?A2=ind2005&L=FSL&P=R27323

although it looks like you will need to run this command first to update the conda solver:

$FSLDIR/bin/conda update -p $FSLDIR conda libmamba -y --solver=classic

( add sudo if necessary )

For the 6.0.5 install I think it would be helpful to know the exact error message, but you may also want to try installing the latest FSL ( 6.0.7.8 ) as that includes “pyfix” which is a python-based rewrite of FIX.

Hope this helps,
Kind Regards
Matthew

Hi Javier

 

As far as I recall, the fdt_paths file contains all the streamlines seeded from your seed masks, regardless of whether they have reached the other seed masks you are using in network mode. However, the output matrix (fdt_network_matrix) of course only records the streamlines that connect pairs of ROIs.  If you want to check the fdt_paths, you can run ptx separately for each seed mask and set the others as waypoint masks.

 

Cheers

Saad

 

Hi Luna

This is nothing to worry about. If I remember correctly, I added that field to help with specifying DCMs using the batch editor. Its omission won’t alter your results.
