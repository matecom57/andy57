Hi,

I solved the issue. I had to add the following line:

from plotly.subplots import make_subplots

To report_xtract_qc.py
How can I check it, please? What should I look for? I opened them in fsleyes.

Thanks
I hope this helps!

Best regards,

Manuel

Hi Blaise,

I've prepared some instructions on setting up a FSL installation by hand at https://git.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/-/snippets/77 - hopefully that is enough to get you started.

Paul

Dear Paul,
Thank you for your very fast response and excuse me for late reply. I was making further tests, including fslreorient2std as you recommended. Images have the same voxel orientation and fslreorient2std did not change the results. I figured out though, that the problem does not starts from flirt but from
standard_space_roi T1_tmp_brain_reor.nii.gz T1_tmp2 -maskNONE -ssref $FSLDIR/data/standard/MNI152_T1_1mm_brain -altinput T1_orig_ud -d

which is creating an affine used later in flirt command.

The attached figure shows all involved volumes and the output of this command.

Any idea of why is this happening?

Best regards,
Georgios

Hi Tamires,

What is the value of "subjdata" just before the call to "nets.load_from_images"?

Paul

Hi Dianne

 

We still recommend using bedpostx for multi-shell data. By default, it will run model 2 instead of model 1 to avoid potentially over-fitting crossing fibres ( see  https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22334356/ )

 

Cheers

Saad

Hi Georgios,

Would you be able to share one of your problematic data sets, along with the specific command that is failing, so I can try and reproduce the issue?

Paul

Dear Michael,

Thank you for your reply, I think I might go down the first route you suggest first as there are not that many files to go through.

I have not used fslstats before, but have seen this command suggested: fslstats image.nii.gz -M -k mask.nii.gz

However, as I do not have a different file with a mask do I need to save the drawn ROI in fsleyes as a mask image?

Many thanks,
Gordon

That would be a good route if you are planning on doing this with a lot of subjects and can more easily automatically define your ROI away from the perfusion images themselves.

Dear group, 

I've used bedpost and probtrack in the past on single-shell data, with a focus on connectivity-based classification.
More recently, we've been acquiring multishell data and I'd appreciate some advice:

Should I use qboot (https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FDT/UserGuide?highlight=%28qboot%29#qboot_-_Estimation_of_fibre_orientations_using_q-ball_ODFs_and_residual_bootstrap) instead of bedpost?

Assuming qboot is a better alternative than bedpost for multishell data, and given that my interest is connectivity-based classification, are there particular optional arguments I should use with qboot?

As far as I'm aware, FSL is still THE tool to use for connectivity-based classification, but if there are other tools/approaches I should consider, could you please suggest them?

Thank you for your time,

Dianne

Hi Matthew,

Originally I was using the MNI reference image MNI152_T1_2mm_brain. The same thing occurs when I use .feat/reg/standard (which I believe is the same image as the MNI152) as well as .feat/reg/func2standard. I am not warping through the anatomical images or using the field map here.

My gui inputs are:

Mode: Input Image -> Reference Image
Reference: .feat/reg/standard.nii.gz
Model/DOF: Affine
Input image: .feat/stats/zfstat1.nii.gz (or cope1)

Best,
Sarah

I have two cope files and one zfstat file that I need to warp to MNI space using flirt. For some reason, the two cope files I am able to transform without any issues but the zfstat file ends up misplaced and not aligned at all to MNI, maybe even rotated.

I'm able to warp the example_func file to MNI just fine and the unwarped zfstat file aligns to the example_func file.

Does anyone have any insights as to what could possibly be different in the zfstat.nii that might cause difficulty in alignment?


Best,
Sarah

Dear,

Is there a way to turn off the brain extraction tool of fsl_anat? This option is not listed as a possible argument.

Thank you,
Eva

Dear FSL,

Sorry to bother you, not sure if this is the right email but this is a query off the back of the recent FSL course that I did.

It was in relation to selecting a particular ROI to determine the perfusion within the VPL nucleus of the thalamus. I performed BASIL and obtained a perfusion value for the thalamus but hoped to select my own region within the thalamus.

I enclose below in FSLeyes, where I was trying to use edit mode to select the posterio-lateral aspect of the thalamus. The select by intensity option did not seem to work. Essentially, I wanted to know the mean perfusion underneath the selected purple area, rather than just the voxel I am clicking on.

Is this possible?

Many thanks,
Gordon

Hello experts,

 

I am having another PNM question –

 

After running the stage 1 (both with command or GUI have I tried), no card and resp txt files are automatically created. I therefore cannot carry on with stage 3. There were no error message about this.

 

I have 2 sets of physiological data recording data file – one sampling at 50hz worked. Another one sampling at 1000hz did not work.  The failing 1000hz one had a "square wave" so I transformed it to "spike", matching similar ones we had here at fmrib.

 

Also, the HTML page has not been successful opening itself.

 

Resources on PNM is very limited so your help will be very much appreciated!

 

Best wishes,

Lin


Dear Julia,
  I think the best practical solution here is to go with the corrcon/corrmod options ( as already in the call ) since the outputs will then be “fully” corrected ( which as mentioned before is why an F-test might be used in other situations ).

Hope this helps,
Kind Regards
Matthew

Ah ok.  Eventually I'll want the whole package, but at the moment, the key tools that would help me are:

flirt
applywarp
fslmaths

And if I can see how to build those, I can probably work our how to compile other tools as I need them.

Dear all,

I am trying to analyse pCASL data using BASIL. I have obtained the perfusion_calib output and also performed regional analysis. However, I was hoping to identify my own region of interest, and determine the perfusion within this region.

Specifically, I want to look at the Ventro-posterio lateral nucleus of the thalamus (the posterior/lateral aspect of the thalamus).

I have tried to go through the 'edit mode' within FSLeyes: Selection mode, choosing a 4mm region, 2D and clicking over the area of interest. However, this only gives me the perfusion for the voxel I click on rather than within the particular region.

Is this the way to identify the region to get the mean perfusion within the selected region or am I missing something?

Many thanks,
Gordon
