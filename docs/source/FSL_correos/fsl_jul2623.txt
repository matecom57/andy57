Hi Paul,

I actually have an additional update - I realize in MobaXterm I didn't have the correct X11-forwarding option set, so after fixing that and running FSLeyes, I was able to open it and change the view settings.

Do you have any suggestions/thoughts as to why it might not be working with VcXsrv?

Thank you,
Jee Won

Hi Alex,

Your internet connection seems to be a little slow (2 minutes to download the 60MB mambaforge installer- based on that, I'd expect the total download (3GB) to take between one and two hours). If you have access to a faster connection (e.g. from your workplace), I'd suggest trying the installation there.

There is a chance that this is simply due to an unreliable internet connection. But there is also a chance that mamba is mis-behaviing. Could you try re-running the installer ilke so?

export MAMBA_NO_LOW_SPEED_LIMIT=1
[python] fslinstaller.py [other options]

Hi,

I'm trying to install fsl on a new mac with Ventura 13.4 that has a Apple M2 Max chip. 

When I run the python installation script, I get the following error:
Exception: Unable to download FSL release manifest from https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsldownloads/fslconda/releases/manifest.json [<urlopen error [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: self signed certificate in certificate chain (_ssl.c:1002)>]!

I looked at the https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsldownloads/fslconda/releases/manifest.json and didn't see an option for macos-M2 and thought that this might be the reason....

Any help is appreciated.

Thanks,
Melissa

    Is it regular attendance each day, and is there are registration fee?

   

    Also, does anyone know when registration is due?

Hi team,

New to using randomise and was wondering what would be the best way to run multiple linear regressions on whole-brain FA maps (from TBSS) using randomise? Or is there another tool I should use instead?
Sorry if I missed that topic somewhere, but would really appreciate any advice here.

Many thanks in advance,

Yann

Hello,
The two files below should work with fslmaths -  can you upload the two files to a download service ( e.g. Google Drive, Dropbox ) and let me know the link so we can investigate locally? fslmaths ( along with many of our other tools ) can only work with images of identical spatial dimensions - is it possible that the previous 1mm mask may have been used with upsampled data ( or conversely downsampled to match the input )?

Kind Regards
Matthew

                   If you are using the system python ( installed via xcode-select ) then can you try adding the following options:

python3 fslinstaller. py --skip_ssl_verify --conda

If you installed Python via https://www.python.org, can you rry running the "Install Certificates" command? There are more details at this link: https://bugs.python.org/msg388144.

Hi Paul,

I found what went wrong (typo in the bash script).
Now fsleyes opens without problems. The creation of the new environment for fsleyes seems to be the solution - brilliant. Thanks so much for all your help.

Best,
Udo



Hello,
 Can you let me know the result of running fslhd on both the input and mask images?

Kind Regards
Matthew

FSL Experts,

*The mask was created from the standard space template (all files are in 2mm space).

In earlier versions of FSL I was able to multiply my zstat file by a left or right hemisphere mask. When attempting to complete the same procedure (fslmaths <filename> -mul <mask name> <output name>), I now get the following error:


WARNING:: Inconsistent orientations for individual images in pipeline!
          Will use voxel-based orientation which is probably incorrect - *PLEASE CHECK*!

Image Exception : #3 :: Attempted to multiply images of different sizes
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::runtime_error'
  what():  Attempted to multiply images of different sizes


How might I remedy this error?

Versions of FSL: 6.0.2 and 6.0.6.4

Cheers,

R

Hi Paul,

you were right, I couldn't downgrade the ffi library (because of my python version). So, I tried your third option but didn't seem to get it right. After running the three commands, when I call fsleyes from the fsl gui I get the following:
bash-3.2$ fsl
sh: /Users/udowill/fsl/bin/fsleyes: /Users/udowill/fsl/bin/env: bad interpreter: No such file or directory

I don't seem to see what went wrong.

Best
Udo



If downgrading the libffi version in your installation fails (as I suspect it will), a third option could be to install a separate copy of FSLeyes. You should be able to do that as follows:

Run this command to create a separate conda environment that just contains FSLeyes:

$FSLDIR/bin/mamba create -n fsleyes fsleyes "libffi=3.3.*"

Open $FSLDIR/bin/fsleyes in a text editor, and replace its contents with the following:

#!/usr/bin/env bash
$FSLDIR/envs/fsleyes/bin/fsleyes "$@"

Update $FSLDIR/share/fsl/bin/fsleyes by running:

cp $FSLDIR/bin/fsleyes $FSLDIR/share/fsl/bin/fsleyes
Then (hopefully) you will be able to run the "fsleyes" command.

Paul

Hi Udo,

This confirms my suspicions. As an interim solution until this problem has been fixed, I think you have two options. Unfortunately neither of these options are guaranteed to work, but hopefully one of them will work for you.

Downgrade the version of libffi in your FSL installation. You can try this by running the following command:

$FSLDIR/bin/mamba install "libffi=3.3.*"

Upgrade to a more recent version of macOS. I think the MacPro 5.1 supports Mojave (10.14) (although this problem has also been reported on that version of macOS).
Paul

Hi Paul,

this is the terminal output running the two commands:

[MacPro-HighS:~] *% fslpython -c 'import send2trash.mac.modern'
Segmentation fault
[MacPro-HighS:~] *% fslpython -c 'import send2trash.mac.legacy'
Segmentation fault

Dear all (apologies for cross posting),
 
We have an opportunity for 2 postdoctoral fellow positions to work in our lab at the Centre for Cognitive Neuroimaging (CCNi) at the University of Glasgow.
 
These posts have a strong computational cognitive neuroimaging component, requiring advances in 1) theoretical neuroscience – to enable the development of a unified computational framework for integrating perceptual and reward learning and decision making – and 2) multimodal brain imaging – to offer a high spatiotemporal characterisation of the relevant cortical and subcortical pathways. The post holder will have the opportunity to be involved in cutting-edge bespoke neuroimaging technology [7TfMRI-EEG fusion] and advanced data analytics to uncover and predict patterns in large multimodal datasets [e.g. behaviour, simultaneous EEG-fMRI and eye-tracking data].
 
For more details and to apply online, please follow the link:
my.corehr.com/pls/uogrecruit/erq_jobspec_version_4.jobspec?p_id=122008
 
Closing date: 31 August 2023


HI Jee Won,

What happens with the latest version of FSL / FSLeyes under MobaXTerm?

Paul

Hi Udo,

I suspect that this problem is with a third party library. Would you be able to perform a test for me, to see if my suspicions are correct? Could you run these command in a terminal and see if any of them result in a segmentation fault?

fslpython -c 'import send2trash.mac.modern'
fslpython -c 'import send2trash.mac.legacy'

Hello,

I'm trying to get the connectivity matrix between 50 ROIs and 120 ROIs.

What is the most suitable option, please?

1- Output the ROIs by ROIs matrix (170 x 170) with the -network option, and then select what I'm interested in.
2- Use the -matrix3 option and then group the voxels by ROIs using the coordinates file.

- I've noticed that the total number of streamlines in matrix1 is different from the total of the network matrix, any explanation, please?

Thanks in advance,
Zakaria

Hi Tamires,
  You can use any GLM design with dual_regression. If I understand your study correctly, you want to correlate a continuous variable ( severity ) with RSN-differences for a single cohort - in that case this design https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/GLM#Single-Group_Average_with_Additional_Covariate should work - you may want to modify the contrasts for your study ( e.g. drop the group-mean, test the opposite direction for the continuous covariate, and use a F-test to test for significance across those contrasts ).

Hope this helps,
Kind Regards
Matthew
