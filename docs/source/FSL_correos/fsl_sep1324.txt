Hi everyone,

 

We recently upgraded our High Performance Computation Center with A100 
GPUs and my lab just received a node with an A6000.

We are running into problems running probtrackx2_gpu on these GPUs. 
Processes get killed or aborted with an illegal data access issue, or out 
of memory error, even though there is plenty of space available.

After trying different CUDA versions and FSL versions, and different 
combinations, always with the same problem, we don’t know what else we can 
do to get probtrackx2_gpu running on Ampere cards. Everything is running 
as expected on our older V100s or K80s.

I tried reaching out to Moisés Hernández Fernández, the original author, 
but with no luck as his Oxford mail address is not working anymore. On the 
original website 
https://users.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/~moisesf/Probtrackx_GPU/Installation.html it 
says “Ampere architecture, and CUDA 11.x binaries will be supported within 
FSL installer starting from FSL 6.0.6” but I still can’t get it to work.

Any suggestions would be highly appreciated.

 

Best wishes,

 

Norman

Subject: [FSL] CUDA Runtime Error: out of memory when running 
probtrackx2_gpu

Dear FSL experts,

I'm running probtrackx2_gpu with the latest version of Qunex (0.99.2d, FSL 
6.0.7.1). I met the following error when running it on Nvidia A100.

...................Allocated GPU 0...................
Device memory available (MB): 48412 ---- Total device memory(MB): 48685
Memory required for allocating data (MB): 897
CUDA Runtime Error: out of memory
Device memory available after copying data (MB): 47476
Running 456412 streamlines in parallel using 2 STREAMS
Total number of streamlines: 577848000

There is clearly enough memory but probtrackx2_gpu reports OOM. I reduced 
the number of samples but the issue still persists.
The error occurs on A100 but did not occur on V100. I have also tried 
multiple versions of CUDA.
The previous steps of HCP Pipelines, gpu version of eddy and bedpostx, 
work fine with the same setting (A100, CUDA 10.2).
I have also tried a potential solution by others (running a concurrent 
program on the gpu), but it did not work for me.

Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!

Here are other reports of the same issue on the Qunex forum and on this 
list:

Hello FSL experts,

 

I am trying to create design and contrast files for use in the FSL 
randomise tool. I wish to study differences between disease (DS) and 
healthy control (HC) subjects. I have 4 different studies, each study with 
its own disease and control subjects. I would like the analysis to control 
for the study of origin, study A controls vs study A disease, study B 
controls vs study B disease, etc. I have attempted an approach previously 
described in JISCMail - FSL Archives, where an EV or dummy variable is 
created for each study, and 1s and 0s to represent study assignment.

 

I would like my contrast matrix to test for HC > DS and DS > HC. Does the 
following setup test for what I am wanting?

 

Design matrix: Each row corresponding to a subject, with 1s representing 
their designation of phenotype and study of origin.

I’ve run this analysis and am skeptical of the results. From how I had set 
up my contrast matrix, I was expecting tstat1 to represent HC > DS and 
tstat2 to represent DS > HC. However, referencing results from a prior 
randomise analysis where I did not control for study of origin, it appears 
that the results I am getting are that tstat1 represents DS > HC and 
tstat2 represents HC > DS.

 

I would like feedback on if my approach is correct. Any help is greatly 
appreciated!

Hi Paul,

thanks for the feedback. Just to check we're on the same page. When you 
say running FSLeyes over VNC - you also mean running FSLeyes within a 
remote desktop session that is accessed via VNC. As that is what we are 
using here. We access a remote desktop through VNC and in that desktop 
open FSLeyes.

FSLeyes works fine with this setup on one server, but not on the other. So 
my suspicion is that it has to do with the way fsl is installed and access 
to libraries on that one server (which unfortunately is where I have to 
install FSL as a module, but otherwise don't have access to server 
management).

Can you confirm what version of FSL you are using? You can find out by

Hi Sean

 

The quantification step combines both grey and white matter contributions. 
It accounts for tissue partial volume estimates from the segmentation, and 
for relaxation properties, as explained in 
https://open.win.ox.ac.uk/pages/fsl/fsl_mrs/quantitation.html.

 

Separating the contributions of grey and white matter is not 
straightforward and would require a specialised acquisition (e.g. varying 
echo time etc) and bespoke modelling.

Dear FSL experts,

Hello,

Just installed fsl using the instructions on Ubuntu 22.04 linux.


sudo python fslinstaller.py

Version: FSL 6.0.7.13


Discovered with this installation that it overrides the Ubuntu system's 
python

%which python
/usr/local/fsl/bin/python

Compared to pre fsl installation

/usr/bin/python

We had an older linux computer, Ubuntu 20.04 with fsl 6.0.5 installed on 
it and we never experienced this python conflict. Noticed that a python 
directory is not located in /usr/local/fsl/lib like python3.11 folder is 
for fsl 6.0.7.13.

Is there a way to install and use the more recent versions of FSL without 
overriding the operating system python and its respective packages?

Thanks.

Hi,

As I understand it, it is usually recommended to use TFCE with TBSS. 
However, my data has three groups and I need to run a F test. After 
reading some posts 
(https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=FSL;ef4412d0.1407), I 
realize that there are some controversies regarding the interpretation of 
p value in TFCE of F test.

I was wondering if it is acceptable to use cluster-based thresholding 
instead of TFCE in TBSS? Or is there another recommended method?

Thanks,
Xinyu

Hi FSL team, 

I am currently using FSL_MRS to try to quantify metabolites from the R 
inferior frontal gyrus in single voxel spectroscopy 

I wanted to ask two questions regarding svs_segment and fsl_mrs:

When we use fsl_mrs in the quantification of metabolite concentrations and 
we use the .json files produced from svs_segmentation, are the metabolites 
in grey matter quantified as a baseline? or is it a combination of grey 
and white matter? 

If I wanted fsl_mrs to selectively quantify the metabolites in the grey or 
white matter or a combination of both what additional flags/commands would 
need to be added for this to be possible? 

Thanks very much, 
Sean

Hi Sorcha (and everyone else),

 

I just thought I should jump in with a little clarification.

 

The reference (Eklund 2016) does not claim that a 3.1 voxel wise threshold 
is "stringent". What they say is that when calculating a voxel-wise 
threshold using Gaussian Random Field Theory (RFT), then the test based on 
that threshold (typically ~4.5) is "conservative", i.e. the true false 
positive rate is lower than the nominal rate (typically 0.05).

 

The main finding of Eklund 1026 is that a cluster-base test with a 
cluster-forming threshold of 2.3, when the cluster-size threshold is 
calculated using RFT, then the test is very "liberal", as in the true 
false positive rate being significantly greater than the nominal rate.

 

For me the take home message from the Eklund paper is: Always use 
randomise (or some other tool based on permutation testing) instead of 
RFT. If you do that you will never be far off the nominal false positive 
rate, regardless of voxel-based or cluster-based inference.

 

As for cluster-based tests with a low cluster-forming threshold (e.g. 2.3) 
they will be "valid" if you use randomise to calculate the cluster-size 
threshold. But, in my mind they will not always be very useful. The 
cluster-size threshold will inevitable be high with such a low 
cluster-forming threshold. That means that any cluster you find will have 
a large spatial extent, potentially spanning several functionally distinct 
areas. And then you will not be able to make any clear claims about any of 
those areas since the inference pertains to the cluster as a whole.

 

Jesper

Hi Sorcha,

 

To add to Matthew's response, the reference that you cite found a 
threshold of 3.1 to be stringent for _voxel-based_ thresholding; for 
cluster-based thresholding (which is the default in the major neuroimaging 
software packages), a threshold of 3.1 is recommended.

Hi Sorcha,
 The problem with lowering to 2.3 ( for parametric statistics ) is that 
certain assumptions start to break down and the actual error rate at a 
nominal significance threshold of 5% will potentially be _much_ higher. To 
use an arbitrary cluster-forming threshold you can switch to a 
non-parametric method ( e.g. randomise with cluster-thresholding in FEAT 
).

Hope this helps,
Kind Regards
Matthew

Dear Lisa,
A subject with a high depression score ( and potentially effect ) isn’t 
necessarily any more likely to be an outlier than any of your other 
subjects. It might to help to think of outliers as subjects with excessive 
variance _after_ the GLM has been been fitted - that it they don’t appear 
to fit the ( Gaussian ) error distribution of the other subjects. 

Hope this helps,
Kind Regards
Matthew

Hi Martyn,

Your reply has indeed helped a lot! I have decided to pursue the approach 
you have mentioned of specifying "the comparison of interest at the 
1st-level and then create the main effects and interaction tests using 
one-sample and two-sample t-tests at the 2nd-level". I assume what you 
mean is similar to the 'Example 2: Three Factors' on this page: 
https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/SPM/Group_Analysis#Example_2:_Three_Factors

I haven't tried the analysis yet but the only doubt I can imagine I will 
have will be how to calculate the post hoc contrasts of the interactions, 
hopefully I will manage it.

And regarding what you have explained to me about the complexity of doing 
this analysis using the flexible factorial module in SPM or in FEAT is 
greatly appreciated as this was definitely not obvious to me.

Cheers,
Harry

Dear all,

I would like to run a higher level FEAT analysis and include a covariate 
(depression score) to examine whether my contrasts vary with depression. 
The depression scores are not uniformly distributed and there are a few 
participants with much higher scores than the others. Usually (when 
running higher level FEAT without any covariates), I would switch on 
outlier deweighting. In this case, however, I wonder whether this would be 
appropriate because I am interested in the inter-individual differences 
related to depression.
Could you give me any guidance on this? (i.e. when it is appropriate or 
not to switch on outlier detection if one also has additional covariates 
in higher level FEAT)

Any help is much appreciated.

Best wishes
Lisa
