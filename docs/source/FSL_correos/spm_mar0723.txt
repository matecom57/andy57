You are showing opposite contrasts G2 > HC and then HC > G2 so it is reassuring the blobs are in different places.  Blue indicates larger p-values, but some blobs appear small in size for a TFCE analysis. If one covariate behaves differently across groups there could be an interaction, e.g., strong age effect in one group but not he other. You could split the age covariate by group in this case and test for different age effects and possibly look at group effect if the covariate is mean centred, but you might want to look stick to the two-group design in that case depending on how the interaction behaves across different groups. The subcortical regions are in areas of poor GM definition/segmentation in typical T1w images, i.e., you may be finding results where there may be low signal or signal for other reasons than atrophy. Look at the uncorrected t-maps to see if the patterns are similar across design and maybe one has only slightly higher values. Sometimes cluster analysis generates results that can come and go whilst uncorrected height thresholds might appear more similar.

From: SPM (Statistical Parametric Mapping) <SPM@JISCMAIL.AC.UK> On Behalf Of Kenji Yoshimura Sent: Friday, February 24, 2023 3:06 PM To: SPM@JISCMAIL.AC.UK Subject: [SPM] Combined or separate design matrix?
 
Dear SPM experts,  I'm trying clustering analysis of patients with a neurological disease (Parkinson's disease), and I obtained 4 groups (G1-4) from 160 patients.  I want to compare the GM atrophy patterns of patients in each cluster to 58 healthy control (HC) data. First, I ran TFCE analysis with a combined design matrix, i.e., one design matrix included all 218 images and nuisance covariates with 5 levels (HC, G1-4) (Fig.1). As a result, patients in G2 showed larger GM volumes in the basal ganglia and the cerebellum, and no GM atrophy (Fig.2). Then, I ran TFCE analysis with 4 separate design matrices, i.e., each design matrix included images and nuisance covariates of HC and only one group (G2 for Fig.3 as an example). Surprisingly, patients in G2 showed mild temporo-parietal GM atrophy in this analysis, and no GM enlargement (Fig.4). In both cases, nuisance covariates were handled with Smith method.  My question is, which result is correct, or which analysis should I use? I think this matter is quite important in the case of multiple group comparison, nevertheless I was unable to find a consensus opinion. Does anyone know which way is appropriate?  Thanks in advance, Best regards.

Dear SPM enthusiasts,

sorry if there are multiple posts, I was uncertain whether my mail reached, so I repost this back.

I have data from an experiment with 3-by-2 design (3 stimulus configurations:''s''; 2 levels of reward:''r''; so 6 conditions in total: [s1r1,s2r1,s3r1,s2r2,s2r2,s3r2] ). Accordingly, my first-level design matrix has 6 regressors for the aforementioned conditions plus the usual nuisance regressors. In the second-level I use a 3*2 flexible factorial design to test the main and interaction effect of ''s'' and ''r'' factors.

My question is regarding how to enter an additional factor into my anlaysis: halfway through the experiment the reward assignments reverse (I call this factor ''tp'', as in time point). I have considered two ways to model ''tp'':
1) I'd just add an additional regressor for factor ''tp'' in my first-level design matrix and keep the second-level analysis as it was.
2) alternatively, I could break down all six regressors ([s1r1,s2r1,s3r1,s2r2,s2r2,s3r2]) to two levels for tp1 and tp2 when creating the first-level analysis (hence having 12 instead of 6 main regressors) and then add one factor in the second-level analysis to model the effect of ''tp'' (i.e., 3*2*2 factorial design).

Intuitively, we think the first method is more powerful and easier to interpret, but we are unsure. Any tips on these methods and specifically regarding which one would be more principled and statistically powerful is greatly appreciated.

Thank you so much!

Best regards,
Jessica Emily Antono

Dear Torben

Yes, the conclusion from figure 3 would be that physiological modelling is still required when using the FAST18 model, and, agreed, it may well be the spatial and temporal variability of the cardiac effect that prevents its removal.

Correct, we used the residuals output form the SPM model estimation.  We didn't test the areas under the curves, so I'm not sure if they are/not preserved, or affected by conversion to dB/Hz.  Our focus instead was on how flat they are across the frequency band, which is consistently improved by FAST18.

Best wishes

Martina

Dear Martina

Thanks for posting this great reference. Am I correct that figure 3 shows, that physiological modelling is needed even if FAST18 is used? It would have been great to see if Volterra expanded motion regressors (24 parameters) can reduce/remove the peak at low frequencies still present in the “No Model” data after HP filtering and RETROICOR modelling, or if we need to do both RETROICOR and FAST when TR is sufficiently low. I think the reason for FAST not being able to remove the cardiac peak in figure 3 TR=0,35s is that the cardiac frequency is not constant through time, and that there is considerable spatial variation both in phase and magnitude. At lower TR it makes the noise look like it is white (because it is aliased into a range of frequencies). I also found it a bit puzzling that the area under the yellow curve sometimes look smaller than or equal to those of the the red and green curve, but I guess you might have used normalised residuals, as those outputted from the SPM model estimation, correct?

Hello,

I'm trying to convert fMRI files to hdr and img. In the first screenshot, you can see the downloaded files (first in .tar.gz, then unzipped). I’m not sure if they really are dicom files.

In the second screenshot, we see that SPM has converted all the files from run1 to only one hdr and one img file. Does anyone know how to help me with that?

Thanks,

Jérémie
