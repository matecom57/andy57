Hello,

I am running a set of analyses using randomise on the WM skeleton. The first analysis is examining the association between a continuous variable (e.g., age) and WM microstructure. The second analysis is examining group differences (CN vs MCI) in WM microstructure. I've read into the archives on this subject and I am confused about when to include the global mean (i.e., EV of all 1s) into the design matrix. Is it correct that when modeling no groups (e.g., a continuous covariate) you must include the global mean as an EV in the model, but when modeling groups the global mean can be inferred across the group EVs?

Thank you in advance,
Jenna

Hi:

  I have FSL 6.0.6.1 in Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS (I installed it using fslinstaller.py). How can I upgrade it to 6.0.6.2 version? Using fslinstaller.py also?

 Sincerely,

Hi Roman,

If you want to get ROIxROI connectivity you should use the --network flag (option 1). Option 2 would also work, but does not give you any benefits. Options 3-4 give biased resutls. The reason is that a single streamline might hit multiple voxels in your target mask. Hence, when you sum over the target mask, most streamlines will be counted multiple times because they hit multiple voxels.

Best wishes,

Michiel

Dear FSL developers and users,

I am trying to compute connectivity between GM regions. It seems there are few options, I would like to understand pros and cons of each.

Use --network. This produces table of connectivity between GM ROIs directly, exactly what is needed.
Use single seed (GM mask) with a table of target GM masks --targetmasks and --os2t. This will produce voxels to ROIs table. I would have to gather seed voxels into GM ROIs to obtain ROI to ROI table as in 1. 
Use --matrix1 with GM as seed mask. This will give voxel to voxel connectivity. I will have to gather start and end voxels according to ROI assignment to obtain ROI to ROI table as in 1.
Use --matrix3 with WM as seed and GM as target. Then as in 3, I will have to gather start and end voxels according to ROI assignment to obtain ROI to ROI table as in 1.

Method 4 is the only one that guarantees symmetric connectivity output, but is the most involved in terms of bookkeeping to gather the results (same level of complexity as approach 3). Overall, approaches 2-4 appear to be overkill compared to approach 1. What is the advantage of implementing each approach, especially approach 4?

Would applying fiber length correction be warranted in any of the approaches and why?

Hi Keita,

I'm afraid I haven't yet been able to gain access to a suitable GPU, so have been unable to reproduce the problem. If you have access to different GPU models, you could try running your job on them.

Dear Paul,

I'm worried about whether you could reproduce the problem or not.
Please let me know if you have any trouble conducting the shared code.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Dear Allesandra,

I am afraid that didn't really help. It looks like you get past the "checking of the input" to where it starts running. Can I ask you to try and run it again, this time adding the --very_verbose flag and ending the command with

&> eddy_output.txt

That will write a _lot_ of info about how it is running to the file eddy_output.txt. And can you then please email me that file (directly to my mail)?

Best regards Jesper

Hi Nooshin,

You can use fslmaths to add the four separate masks together, and then binarise the result, e.g.

fslmaths mask1.nii.gz -add mask2.nii.gz -add mask3.nii.gz -bin out.nii.gz

Hi FSL experts,

I'm interested in building a mask that overlap the 4 Cingulum right, Cingulum left, superior longitudinal fasciculus L and superior longitudinal fasciculus right using JHU ICBM atlas. I know how to make mask for each one within FSLeyes but I'm not sure how to make a single mask while overlapping all of them together.
Thanks for your help in advance.

Hi Maurilio,

I'm guessing that $FSLDIR/bin/ is being added to your $PATH somewhere in your profile configuration (e.g. ~/.profile, ~/.bashrc, etc) - if you can find and remove that, then you should be able to resolve this problem.

In versions of FSL prior to 6.0.6, $FSLDIR/bin/ needed to be added to the $PATH. But for FSL 6.0.6 and newer, $FSLDIR/share/fsl/bin/ needs to be added instead.

Subject: [FSL] fsl python "hides" system python in PATH
 
Hi all,
I'm facing an issue after installing fsl in both linux and mac.
After installing fsl, if I try to use python3 command in a shell the system calls the fsl python3 executable instead of my main system python3 installation.
To be clear, if I type <which python3> I will get: /home/username/fsl/bin/python3

In .profile I have the standard fsl setup added during installation:
FSLDIR=/home/username/fsl
PATH=${FSLDIR}/share/fsl/bin:${PATH}
export FSLDIR PATH
. ${FSLDIR}/etc/fslconf/fsl.sh

my PATH variable after fsl installation is:
/home/username/freesurfer/bin:/home/username/freesurfer/fsfast/bin:/home/username/freesurfer/tktools:/home/username/fsl/bin:/home/username/fsl/share/fsl/bin:/home/username/freesurfer/mni/bin:/home/username/fsl/share/fsl/bin:/home/username/fsl/share/fsl/bin:/home/username/.local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin:/snap/bin

Moreover in the last few weeks I instaled fsl on various computers and this problem only sometimes appears.
Am I doing something wrong during installation? Is it a known or expected behaviour?

Thank you

Hi FSL experts,

I'm interested in building a mask that overlap the 4 Cingulum right, Cingulum left, superior longitudinal fasciculus L and superior longitudinal fasciculus right using JHU ICBM atlas. I know how to make mask for each one within FSLeyes but I'm not sure how to make a single mask while overlapping all of them together.
Thanks for your help in advance.

Sincerely,
Nooshin

Dear FSL developers and users,

I am trying to compute connectivity between GM regions. It seems there are few options, I would like to understand pros and cons of each.

Use --network. This produces table of connectivity between GM ROIs directly, exactly what is needed.
Use single seed (GM mask) with a table of target GM masks --targetmasks and --os2t. This will produce voxels to ROIs table. I would have to gather seed voxels into GM ROIs to obtain ROI to ROI table as in 1.
Use --matrix1 with GM as seed mask. This will give voxel to voxel connectivity. I will have to gather start and end voxels according to ROI assignment to obtain ROI to ROI table as in 1.
Use --matrix3 with WM as seed and GM as target. Then as in 3, I will have to gather start and end voxels according to ROI assignment to obtain ROI to ROI table as in 1.

Method 4 is the only one that guarantees symmetric connectivity output, but is the most involved in terms of bookkeeping to gather the results (same level of complexity as approach 3). Overall, approaches 2-4 appear to be overkill compared to approach 1. What is the advantage of implementing each approach, especially approach 4?

Would applying fiber length correction be warranted in any of the approaches and why?
