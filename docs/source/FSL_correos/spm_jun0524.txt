Dear spm community,

 

I have a question about how to transform images from one MNI space to another in spm12.

 

More specifically, I have processed fMRI data in spm12 and obtained some clusters that I would now like to use as ROIs for my structural data processed 
with cat12. Unfortunately, spm12 and cat12 seem to use different MNI spaces (i.e. MNI152NLin2009cAsym in cat12). Therefore, I need to transform my ROIs 
coming from the functional data.

What would be the best way to transform the clusters/ROIs from spm12 MNI space to cat12 MNI space?
Could I use the tpm templates to compute a transformation matrix? How would that look like in spm?
What do I do about the different matrix dimensions for tpm templates in spm and for my preprocessed functional images? (see details of the dimensions 
below)
 

matrix dimensions 

spm12 fmri space:

- 79x95x79 for my preprocessed and analyzed functional images

- 121x145x121 for spm tpm templates

 

cat12 smri space:

- 113x137x113 for my preprocessed structural images

- 113x137x113  for cat12 tpm templates

 

Thank you in advance for your assistance!

 

Best,

Maike

Hi Alfonso,

thanks for the tip. That was my first thought too. Obviously it wasn't that. There is relatively little movement in the data.

But I have found my "mistake": If you work with 4D Nifti files and exclude the first few scans, e.g. for the realignment, these are still written to the 
4D files during reslicing, but without values or as 0. It took me a while to discover this by chance.
But thanks for your tip regarding the movement. That was another reason for me to pay special attention to it!

Cheers,
Gregor

Dear SPM users,

While doing a first level model estimation using FIR basis functions, should one incorporate durations (ie., 10s) from their event/onset files or 
incorporate events to the model with a duration of 0? 

Would there be any use cases whereby one would need to define a duration while using FIR as a basis function?

When I checked the design matrix for specifying the duration as 0, the corresponding value for my regressor was set to 16 (see picture below). I am also 
curious why this number is set to 16. As for when specifying a duration, the design matrix was different than the one below.

Hi Karina,

I have a script that may help. It iterates over regions of an atlas for different contrasts. You can tweak it to do either task above,

Dear Gregor,

it's described in the Quick Start guide:
https://neuro-jena.github.io/cat12-help/#add_surf

- Optionally Extract ROI-based Surface Values such as gyrification or fractal dimension to provide ROI analysis. Since version 12.7 extraction of 
ROI-based thickness is not necessary anymore because this is now included in the segmentation pipeline.
- Optionally estimate results for ROI analysis using Analyze ROIs. Here, the SPM.mat file of the already estimated statistical design will be used. For 
more information, see Atlas Creation and ROI based Analysis.

Thus, you have to extract the gyrification values first. Then new files in the label folder are saved (catROIs_*). Of course, you need an analysis of the 
gyrification first to move on with the ROI analysis.

Best,

Christian


Dear Christian, dear CAT experts,

I have a problem with the ROI analysis regarding gyrification. When I start the ROI analysis, which files do I need so that I can evaluate the 
gyrification? I have the ROI files in the labels folder. But when I use them, I can only select GM, WM or CSF in the further dialog. I must have left out 
a step somewhere or taken a wrong turn. Although the CAT manual is great, I can't find the solution. Maybe someone can help me with a little hint. I'm 
not sure if the description of the problem was clear.

Thank you so much!
Cheers, Gregor


Hey all, beginner here!

I am working on a modified/adapted version of the PEB tutorial scrip and I get the following error message:

Dear SPMers,
Do any of you has a script that could be recursively used to extract the time series of a volume of interest?

There are to scenarions that we are interested in:

1. Selecting the coordinate for the peak activity for that VOI, example the amygdala for that participant.

Or if the above is not possible to script.

1. Selecting the same coordinate for that VOI for all the participants recursively.

Warmly and please let us know?
Karina

Hello SPM-ers,

I have been setting up some pretty simple batch scripts over the last two days, and have run into an issue - the inputs​ cell array is filled with my 
arguments / options, etc., but the batch itself is not being filled. Running:

spm_jobman('interactive', jobs, inputs{:});​

to check this in the GUI, all of the open inputs remain open and unfilled. Attempting to run the job with spm_jobman('run', jobs, inputs{:})​ simply 
produces the error: "Error using spm_jobman>fill_run_job No executable modules, but still unresolved dependencies or incomplete module inputs." No other 
error or output is given.

This is the second time this has happened - it first occurred on a completely different batch I was setting up last night, which is why I started fresh 
with this one. The script is incredibly simple, just reading and cleaning up some file paths and sticking them in the cell array. I've double-checked the 
entirety of inputs{:}​, which contains all the expected values in the right places. All of the targets are correct, confirmed with exist()​. For whatever 
reason, this just does not seem to be reaching the batch system. This is stored on my own external drive that I have full read/write permissions for. 
Script is below, just in case (I'm aware some of the inputs are probably the wrong type, but it isn't producing any relevant error messages for me so I 
can't correct these at the moment):
JD_dir = fullfile("D:\Research\WT\Imaging\Jacobian CAT12\JD\Maps\Masked\Original");​
output_dir = fullfile("D:\Research\WT\Imaging\Jacobian CAT12\Statistics\SingleSubjects");​
JDs = dir(fullfile(JD_dir, "*.nii"));​
JDs = {JDs.name};​
patient_JDs = JDs(~contains(JDs(:), 'CON'));​
​
substrings = ["wj_T1_asl_", ".nii"];​
targets = string(0);​
outputs = string(0);​

for i = 1:length(patient_JDs)​
      targets(i) = fullfile(JD_dir, patient_JDs(i));​
      outputs(i) = fullfile(output_dir, erase(patient_JDs(i), substrings));​
      disp(targets(i) + " => " + outputs(i));​
end​

% - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - %​
nrun = length(targets);​
jobfile = {'D:\Research\WT\Imaging\Jacobian CAT12\SingleSubject_JD_Driver_job.m'};​
jobs = repmat(jobfile, 1, nrun);​
inputs = cell(4, nrun);​
for crun = 1:nrun​
      inputs{1, crun} = cellstr(outputs{crun}); % Basic models: Directory - cfg_files​
      inputs{2, crun} = cellstr(targets{crun}); % Basic models: Group 2 scans - cfg_files​
      inputs{3, crun} = "FDR"; % Results Report: Threshold type - cfg_menu​
      inputs{4, crun} = 0.05; % Results Report: Threshold - cfg_entry​
end​
spm('defaults', 'PET');​
spm_jobman('run', jobs, inputs{:});
I'm sure this is a really straightforward issue that I'm simply not seeing, so any advice would be appreciated!

Best wishes,
Rowan

Hi Christian,

I wanted to ping this thread, as I'm unsure how to resolve this GIFTI issue I'm having with the surface model estimation. I was able to successfully 
perform the previous QA checks, so it appears that the GIFTI files are being properly read. I've tried modifying some of the underlying CAT12 code (e.g. 
read_gifti_file.m), but this hasn't solved my problem.

Is there some other way to assess the quality of the GIFTI files, or should I try a different approach?

Thanks again,

Dan

Hi Martyn

Thank you for the reply. I have indeed read your paper; it was very detailed and comprehensive.

Could you possibly expand on how I would go about defining multiple contrasts at the first level between subjects? To clarify, I have 13 subjects, who 
performed the same task 4 times, but each with a different condition (4).


Thank you
Michael

Hi,

If all images are already in MNI space, I believe a simple reslicing (without coregistration) should work. Maybe someone else will confirm this.

Best,

Michel

Dear Carles,

Thanks for your suggestion! I removed the regressors including the site, age and gender from the GLM, however the issue remains unresolved. I think issue 
might have occurred during preprocessing the T1W/T2W structural dataset and not due to the inclusion of regressors.

                                                                                thanks,
