Hi Olga,

It is not unusual for a small number of voxels within the brain mask to be negative, as long as the brain mask is reasonable, and there are only a small number of negative voxels. You may need to use a more conservative mask for your tSnR calculations.

Dear FSL experts,
I'm reaching out again regarding the below issue with single-level FEAT preprocessing.
Your input will be much appreciated.
Many thanks,
Olga Kepinska



Hi Gina,

This is probably due to a change in recent versions of macOS - you should be able to follow the instructions from this post to fix this on your system: https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa-jisc.exe?A2=FSL;d24328c4.2301

Subject: [FSL] Dual Regression Error
 
Dear experts,

I am trying to do a dual regression and unfortunately I keep getting error messages. After I was able to run the group_ica successfully (groupICA_REST1.ica), my command looks like this (using the identical subject_list-file from group_ica):

dual_regression groupICA_REST1/melodic_IC.nii.gz 1 design/GLM_cort_REST1.mat design/GLM_cort_REST1.con 5000 groupICA_REST1_cort.dr `cat subjects_REST1.txt`

When I run this command, I immediately get the error:
creating common mask
Fatal error: cannot open file: -
    Function: (main)

I saw in the archive that it might be the quotation marks around the `cat ...` part.
If I change this to "cat ...", the result is:
/Users/fsl/bin/dual_regression: line 138: [: too many arguments
creating common mask
Error submitting job - Array task definition file fault: Unable to read 'test/scripts+logs/drA'.

When I try the following command: dual_regression groupICA_REST1/melodic_IC.nii.gz 1 -1 5000 groupICA_REST1.dr "cat subjects_REST1.txt"

... then I get this error message:
creating common mask
doing the dual regressions
Error submitting job - Array task definition file fault: Unable to read 'groupICA_REST1_cort.dr/scripts+logs/drC'
sorting maps and running randomise

Fatal error: cannot open file: -
    Function: (main)

There is no drC in the scripts+logs folder. Instead there are the following files: drA, drB and drE.


I am totally lost! What is the problem here?
Thanks in advance!
Gina

We want to perform a regression y ~ age + group where group
is (ASD|TDC) in a cohort containing subjects diagnosed with 
autism and typically developing controls.

however the two groups have statistically significant differences in variance as determined by
an F test. The difference does not appear to be related to age, i.e. does not appear to be an example 
of heteroscedasticity.


the data would thus seem to violate the linear model assumption of homogeneity.

Looking at the documentation for PALM it is stated that PALM can produce valid results in the presence of heteroscedasticity,
but there is no mention regarding if PALM can gives valid results if the data groups exhibit heterogeneity ?

so im asking if I can use PALM for data that has this more general form of differences in
variance between the diagnostic groups and for any specific procedure to be implemented
to ensure valid results of a statistical inference for main effect of group and interactions group*age

I hope my question is clear enough

thank you in advance

Greg
