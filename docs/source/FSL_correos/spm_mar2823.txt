Hello everyone,

I have a very greenhorn-comprehensive question about a 2nd Level fMRI ROI analysis, where I want to apply a small volume correction and a significance level of p -value FWE-corrected = 0.05.

I get different results with two different approaches:

1) select my contrast --> apply p uncorrected of 0.001 --> then in the results panel I click on "small volume" and select my ROI-mask I have created from a functional localizer earlier --> In my Stats-Table, I have several significant clusters below a FWE-corrected p-value of 0.05.

2) same procedure, but apply in the first step already a FWE-corrected p-value --> click on "small volume", select my ROI --> now I do not have any significant clusters anymore.

I was wondering what the difference between those two appoaches is? Why do I have some significant FWE-corrected p-values in one approach and not in the other, even though the only difference seems to be if I "filter" first or filter visually for FWE in my stats-table?

And which approach would be the recommended one?

Your advice is highly appreciated and thank you very much for your help in advance!


Best,
Lisa

many thanks! eventually the enhanced siemens file could be imported either by spm12 (takes ages but works) or by mricrogl (fast and creates 4d files). i will make sure the coregistration works fine and let you know if i observe some weird reconstructions. kind regards, Gyula

Hi, I am analyzing SPECT images but I am having some issues with SPM SPECT template. In SPM12, there is no SPECT template provided, so I searched in SPM2 version. However, when I display the orientation of SPM2 SPECT template, it is not quite what I expected: The sargittal view is pointing to the right instead of pointing to the left.

Does anyone know whether there is any difference from SPM2 to SPM12 versions that changed the way that templates are oriented ?

For this analysis, I am following the instructions provided in this manual:
http://spect.yale.edu/analysis_details.html

They suggest that images should be oriented as the template, which does not correspond to what I see when I open in SPM12:

Frontal view (pane 1) of the brain is upright
Sagittal view (pane 2) is pointing left (in my case it is pointing to the right)
Transverse view (pane 3) is pointing up

You can check out the template orientation in the following link:
https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1DgcnCC502jqvYzsKEjoYmdKGsTQy_fV1

Do you have any suggestions?
Kindly regards


Dear Tamer,

Thanks for the report. Which operating system are you using? Similar behaviour has already been observed (see e.g.   https://github.com/spm/spm/issues/4

Windows 11 Performance · Issue #4 · spm/spm
I am experiencing some severe performance issues on Windows 11 that are not present on Ubuntu 22.04. For instance, smoothing a functional file containing 375 volumes takes around 9 seconds on Ubunt...
github.com
) but I haven't been able to reproduce it myself yet. I do have some guesses of what might be going on though. Could you run the profiler when smoothing a 4D file and send me a zip file of the report:

profile on
...smooth 4D file...
profsave(profile('info'),'profile_smooth');
zip('profile_smooth.zip','profile_smooth');

Best regards,
Guillaume.

Hello,

I noticed that using 4D NIfTI is much slower compared to 3D for some SPM functions (such as realignment or smoothing) 

Did anyone else experience this behaviour? Could there be a way to optimize it?

Hi Lisa, 

I can come up with an explanation to my knowledge.  Every time you apply a correction, you will get a thresholded SPM. The color blobs in your SPM are voxels that survived the threshold. The stricter your threshold becomes, the fewer voxels you will have.

Imagine your ROI is a sphere superimposed on the SPM. SVC will encircle all voxels within that sphere based on that current SPM, and then redefine the search volume to these voxels.  Before any corrections, your ROI will surely contain many voxels—let's say 100 voxels. 

When you apply a slight correction, the voxels in this sphere region might drop to 50 voxels,  because fewer voxels will survive. Now, SVC will encircle all 50 voxels within that sphere and redefine the search volume to all 50 exsisting voxels, still might be able to produce significant clusters. 

But after FEW corrections of p= 0.05, there might be 0 or 1 or 2 voxels in your ROI. Apparently, you might have no significant results now, since your search volume contains no voxels at all or very few voxels. 




Personally, I suppose this method is reasonable. 
1) select my contrast --> apply p uncorrected of 0.001 --> then in the results panel I click on "small volume" and select my ROI-mask I have created from a functional localizer earlier --> In my Stats-Table, I have several significant clusters below a FWE-corrected p-value of 0.05.

Mu Nan

I have no idea how to solve the issue because I haven't seen what's changed in the DICOM files.  If there are no privacy concerns, making a small number of example DICOMs available to people who develop converters might help - otherwise they can't fix the problem.

All the best,
-John

⚠ Caution: External sender


we received a new siemens prisma, which uses these enhanced dicoms where each slice is a separate file. for the functional mri images spm12 is unable to import this any more imo. what am i missing here??? any idea how to solve the issue? (the structural worked just fine).
thanks in advance,
gyula

Using SPM12 (and most other nifti converters) to convert the enhanced dicoms from the new Siemens system is a problem.  There are several other save options from the scanner -- sorry, I'm drawing a blank at the moment on their naming convention -- all of which can be converted by SPM12.  Although the Siemens tech support claim there is some difference between these other options, I have not found any for processing either fMRI or structural images.

One note of caution from my recent experience.  After Siemens installed their latest software (XA), we have had problems generating good coregistration between the fMRI and structural images.  My group has been interacting with Siemens on this for the past year, but the problem has not yet been resolved.  My latest analysis indicates that the structural images (including MPRAGE & flair) use a coordinate system that is slightly rotated along the AP axis relative to the fMRI images, which uses the same coordinate system as in earlier Siemens operating systems.  The result is "activation" appears displaced when superimposed on the structural image, with displacement greater the further the activation cluster is from the origin (coordinates 0,0,0).  As a result, activation in sensorimotor cortex during a motor task appears somewhat posterior and extends outside of the brain, typically extending to the skull.  We have never had this problem with earlier Siemens software, nor on our Siemens scanner that has not yet had the software upgrade.

If other people have noticed this as well, please comment, as Siemens is telling us no one else has observed this.  (They are suggesting the problem is with our processing stream, even though we have never had this problem with many hundreds of patients and research subjects prior to this upgrade.)

I'm in the process of writing up / providing graphic proof of the problem to present to Siemens, which I hope will finally lead to their resolution of the issue.  I have not yet figured out a workaround.  I will try to update the SPM listserv once there is a resolution.
