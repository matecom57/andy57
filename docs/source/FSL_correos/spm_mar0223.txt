**Brief description of the position**

We are seeking a highly motivated Postdoctoral Researcher to join the A.I. Virtanen Institute for Molecular Sciences at the Faculty of Health Sciences in Kuopio, Finland. In this role, you will have the opportunity to conduct technical research in the field of neuroscience, specifically by developing and applying computational neuroimaging (MRI) analysis methods to projects primarily focusing on neurodegenerative diseases. The appointee will work closely with Academy Research Fellow Dogu Baran Aydogan and Prof. Jussi Tohka.

Specific responsibilities include:

* Developing computational methods for connectivity and microstructure analysis with the aim of achieving technical objectives, such as predicting disease progression or developing biomarkers
* Developing image processing and data analysis pipelines, especially for diffusion MRI and tractography, to study large datasets such as ADNI
* Authoring high-quality scientific papers and contributing to the preparation of research projects.

We welcome candidates with an interest in multimodal data (e.g., multimodal imaging, EEG, genetics, behaviour) and a strong desire to take an integrative approach to understanding the brain and its disorders.

**Our requirements and expectations**

* A doctoral degree in a relevant discipline
* Excellent scientific communication skills in English, both in terms of writing scientific papers and presenting research work
* Hands-on experience in data analysis and method development (machine learning, complex networks, image/signal analysis) for neuroscientific applications
* Strong programming and computational skills
* Excellent collaboration skills
* Experience in collaborating with multi-disciplinary academic research groups, hospitals, and industrial partners
* Experience in managing research projects and teams, practical experience from top-level international research institutes, and previous experience in neuroscience are considered to be assets
* Previous experience in the supervision of PhD and MSc students and a successful track record of acquiring external funding are beneficial but not mandatory.

Research Fellow (Postdoctoral)
University of Birmingham - School of Psychology - Centre for Human Brain Health
Salary: £32,348 to £42,155 full time starting salary range, with potential progression once in post to £44,737, Grade 7
Hours:  Full Time
Closes: 22nd March 2023
Contract:   Fixed Term contract up to two years with potential extension

We are seeking a motivated postdoctoral researcher to join the Motivation and Social Neuroscience lab (https://www.msn-lab.com) led by Dr. Matthew Apps. The lab studies the cognitive, computational and neurobiological basis of motivation and decision-making in healthy young adults, across the lifespan and in neurological and psychiatric disorders. This post is funded by Fellowships and grants from the BBSRC, ERC, Wellcome Trust and Jacobs Foundation, totalling over £4m.

An initial 2 year postdoctoral position (with possibility of extension) is available from 1st April 2023, or as soon as possible thereafter.

The main focus of this role will be on the design, collection and analysis of novel model-based behavioural, and neuroimaging experiments with the potential for novel neuroimaging methods (e.g. Spinal fMRI or OPM-MEG). In addition, the post holder may also be involved in behavioural, psychopharmacology, and neuroimaging studies involving children, adolescents and older adults. The position is broad and can be in part tailored to the applicants interest, and there is the opportunity to analyse existing data. There will be opportunities to collaborate with colleagues in the University of Oxford (Prof. Masud Husain and Prof. Catherine Harmer), University of California, San Francisco (Dr. Simon Little) and in Berlin (Prof. Radek Cichy).

The successful candidate will be resourceful with the ability to act on their own initiative, excellent quantitative skills including programming (e.g. Matlab, R or Python) for the design and analysis of experiments. Experience of neuroimaging (e.g. fMRI or MEG) is essential and experience of computational modelling, studies with diverse populations (children, adolescents, older adults), and advanced neuroimaging techniques (model-based imaging, MVPA or RSA) is desirable but not necessary.

The work will build on studies such as this:
1.    Müller, T., Klein-Flügge, M. C., Manohar, S. G., Husain, M. & Apps, M. A. J. Neural and computational mechanisms of momentary fatigue and persistence in effort-based choice. Nature Communications. 12, 4593 (2021).
2.    Lockwood, P. L. … Apps, M.A. Distinct neural representations for prosocial and self-benefiting effort. Current Biology 32, 4172–4185 (2022).
3.    Apps, M. A. J., Rushworth, M. F. S. & Chang, S. W. C. The Anterior Cingulate Gyrus and Social Cognition: Tracking the Motivation of Others. Neuron 90, 692–707 (2016).
4.    Le Heron, C. et al. Dopamine modulates dynamic decision-making during foraging. Journal of Neuroscience. 40, 5273–5282 (2020).

Main Duties

- Contributing to the design and programming of behavioural and/or neuroimaging experiments
- Running experiments involving behavioural and neuroimaging measures (e.g. fMRI, MEG)
- Recruiting and contacting participants
- Analysing behavioural and brain imaging data using advanced analysis tools (e.g. computational modelling)
- Writing and contributing to manuscripts for research publications, and presenting data
- Work collaboratively with other members of the group, the centre and wider school
- Helping to look after and ordering relevant equipment when required
- Assisting the laboratory head with supervision of student projects and outreach activities

Person Specification

- Have or be close to the completion of a PhD in cognitive neuroscience, neuroimaging, experimental psychology or a closely related discipline
- Experience in designing/conducting or analysing neuroimaging data (e.g. fMRI and/or MEG)
- Experience in the design, coding and analysis of behavioural experiments
- Strong quantitative and programming skills, and knowledge of one or more relevant programming languages (e.g. Matlab; Python; R)
- Experience of writing and publishing peer reviewed scientific papers or preprints
- Ability to work independently
- Resourcefulness and organisational skills to act on own initiative
- Strong presentation skills including the ability to present research proposals and results, and represent the lab at meetings

Dear DCM experts,

 

I am running a simple 2 node DCM model for a large scale task fMRI data and have a question about cross validation methods other than LOO for PEB models.

Here are the steps I took:

I have split my data to discovery and test samples
Found ROIs MNI coordinates based on the fMRI group level analysis in discovery sample.
Estimated subject-specific ROIs for all the subjects
Run first level DCM for all the subjects
Run second level DCM (PEB) model for discovery sample.
 

Now I want to check for cross validation in my test sample. Considering this I have a few ideas that I am not sure if they would work:

To run PEB model for test sample and simply compare the results with discovery sample to see if they are in line or not.
To set a threshold (let’s say 0.95) for weighted parameters in PEB model. Define a binary model based on this threshold (1 for all the parameters greater than 0.95 and 0 for all <0.95)  and do DCM for this specific model in test sample.
 

I would be grateful if you could help me and let me know if any of these two makes sense to you and also if you have any other suggestions for cross validation in this case.

 

Thanks in advance,

Best,

Ehssan
