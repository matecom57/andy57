Dear Jack,
 
    Hi Jesper
   
    >One way around this is to use applywarp instead of flirt. You can use it without a warp, supplying only a transformation matrix. It has  a parameter called --super, which will "super-sample" the new volume, before then averaging neighbouring voxels. So if your new resolution is 3mm and you specify "--super --superlevel=2", it will create the new volume at 1.5mm resolution, after which neighbouring voxels will be average down to a resolution of 3mm.
   
    I tried to do as suggested but this method does not seem to work for me.  When I used --supersample=2, I still got an empty output.  So, under the assumption that I am still "missing" the location of the voxel,
 
I sounds unlikely (though I guess not completely impossible) that you would miss the voxel completely with --supersample=2. Do you think it might just be a matter of being "tricked" by the "robust range" scaling (which would effectively ignore a single non-zero voxel)? What do you get if you do
fslstats 'my image' -R
?
 
I tried --supersample=3, but got the following error:
    "Supersampling renders output image too large"
   
It is not the size of the input image that matters here. What applywarp does is to transform the image and resample it to the matrix given by the --ref parameter. So say for example that the image you specify as --ref is 100x100x100 and that you specify --supersamp=3. That means that an image of size 300x300x300 will be created internally, before being subsampled by averaging each 3x3x3 neighbourhood. It is the size of the internal 300x300x300 image that matters. So if you want to experiment with small images and high --supersample factors it is the --ref image that you need to make smaller.
But you should also match the size of the input image in order to make sure that your pixel doesn't end up outside of the FOV of the output image. You should also make sure that your transform matrix doesn't cause a large translation outside of the FOV (that would be another way in which you could end up "missing" your voxel).

    So I did the following experiment.
    I started with a file with the following parameters:
   
    scales=[0.6   0.5078  0.5078]
    dim=[280 512 512]
    FOV=[168 260 260]
    total_num_voxels=73400320
   
    Using  --supersample=2, I received no error and got these parameters:
   
    scales=[0.3000    0.2539    0.2539]
    dim=[560 1024 1024]
    FOV=[168 260 260]
    total_num_voxels=587202560
   
    However, if I started with a much smaller file:
   
    scales=[0.6   0.5078  0.5078]
    dim=[21 21 21]
    FOV=[12.6  10.6638  10.6638]
    total_num_voxels=9261
   
    and then used --supersample=3, I received the "Supersampling renders output image too large" error, even though this output should be about an order of magnitude smaller than the supersample=2 output:
   
    --supersample=3
    scales=[0.2000    0.1693    0.1693]
    dim=[280  512  512]
    FOV=[12.6  10.6638  10.6638];
    total_num_voxels=73400320;
   
    Any thoughts on why -supersample=3 fails?
    thanks!!

Hi Rob,

Currently your only options are to modify the FSLeyes installation ($FSLDIR/lib/python3.10/site-packages/assets), or to modify the per-user configuration directory (~/.config/fsleyes/). However, I don't think it would be difficult to adjust FSLeyes to also check a separate system-wide location - I will add this to the list for the next release.

Or, if you have the time, and get to it before me, PRs are welcome at https://github.com/pauldmccarthy/fsleyes/. The file that would need to be modified is fsleyes/colourmaps.py. Currently it is tightly coupled to the concept of checking only two directories - the installation assets/ directory, and the user settings directory, but it should be fairly straightforward to modify it to support searching more than one settings directory.

Hi Rob, 

I believe that you need to make changes at several sub-folders, such as, 
~/.fsleyes/luts/ 
/site-packages/fsleyes/assets/luts/  
/site-packages/fsleyes/assets/colormaps/ 
/site-packages/fsleyes/displaycontext/

After the above changes, you need to sudo chmod a+x $FSLDIR. It is better to add your own colormaps after the default ones.  

Best wishes,

Shanrong

Hi,
 
Our lab has about a dozen colormaps and luts that are extensively used, including by visiting researchers, summer interns, etc. that we’d like to get set up quickly. Is there a way to get fsleyes to check a system-wide path for them? (in Linux)
 
I’ve read https://open.win.ox.ac.uk/pages/fsl/fsleyes/fsleyes/userdoc/customising.html and gotten it to work with ~/.config/fsleyes/luts/, but I would like to add files to a central location and have the colormaps and luts be available to everyone without making them run a script to set up their ~/.config/fsleyes. (We could do that, but first I wanted to check that I’m not missing something.)
 
I also found $FSLDIR/lib/python3.10/site-packages/assets and had some success with editing order.txt, but for some reason copying new versions of the files there isn’t taking effect.
Ideally we would like fsleyes to effectively check a system config path (an environment variable, probably) in between the check for ~/.config/fsleyes and the $FSLDIR builtin items. It would also mostly decouple our local customizations (cluster jobs come to mind, but are out of scope for fsleyes) from FSL updates. 
 
We’re very grateful for fsleyes being made available, and I would be happy to contribute a patch if pointed at where I should start hacking.
 
Thanks,
 
Rob

Dear Jack,

no, there shouldn't be any such "minimum voxel volume". I suspect that what happens here is the you/flirt simply misses your one voxel when resampling to the lower resolution.

With tri-linear interpolation you look at where a voxel in the new (low resolution space) falls within the old space, and then uses the 8 surrounding voxels in the old space to work out the intensity. But let's say for example that your original resolution is 1mm, and you resample to 3mm. You will then "miss" some of the voxels in the original space, i.e. they will never be part of the eight surrounding points. They will quite simply be ignored. Exactly which ones will be considered will depend on your transformation matrix.

One way around this is to use applywarp instead of flirt. You can use it without a warp, supplying only a transformation matrix. It has  a parameter called --super, which will "super-sample" the new volume, before then averaging neighbouring voxels. So if your new resolution is 3mm and you specify "--super --superlevel=2", it will create the new volume at 1.5mm resolution, after which neighbouring voxels will be average down to a resolution of 3mm.

Jesper

    When the new voxel resolution is greater than 3mm3, I get what appears to be an accurate interpolation.  When the new voxel resolution is less than 3mm3, FLIRT appears to round down to zero.
    Is this expected behavior?

Hi Brice,

Perhaps your proxy is interfering with HTTPS/SSL certificate validation - you might have some success running the installer with the --skip_ssl_verify option, e.g.:

fslinstaller.py --skip_ssl_verify -d /usr/local/fsl-6.0.6.5 -V 6.0.6.5

Paul

Hi Matthew,
Just checking if it is absolutely necessary to have all unbetted images in the same folder. And if I need anything else to run fslvbm_2.
Thank you
Shuo

Hi Brice,

There is one report suggesting that mamba has trouble behind a proxy - are you able to try using conda instead to see if that does any better?

sudo /usr/local/fsl-6.0.6.5/bin/conda env update -n base -f fsl-6.0.6.5_linux-64.yml

If this appears to work, you can:
cancel the operation
download an updated version of the fslinstaller script from https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsldownloads/fslconda/releases/fslinstaller.py
Run the installer script like: fslinstaller.py --conda -d /usr/local/fsl-6.0.6.5 -V 6.0.6.5

Hi Udo,

Can you try re-running the first installer script, with the --skip_ssl_verify option?

Hi Vae,
   The second error ( Fatal error: cannot open file: - ) should be solved by updating to the latest FSL ( 6.0.6.5 ) as this is a known interaction between our scripts and Ventura. Once updated can you try re-running the command ( deleting the output folder first, if it exists )?

Kind Regards
Matthew

Hi Jael,
To make sure this isn't some kind of strange path issue, can you re-run passing the absolute path to the output folder?

Kind Regards
Matthew

I have tried running this line of script before, and it worked fine previously before I updated my M1 Mac ventura 13.4. Could this be the problem?

Thank you!

Hi Theo

 


How much diffusion weighted volumes are required (at minimum) to run dtifit?

 

I would recommend reading some of the early papers by Derek Jones addressing this question.



Also, I have a bvec-file containing only 0's. What does that mean?

 

That should not be a problem. Usually this indicates that the associated bvalue is also zero.

 

Cheers

Saad

Hi Aleta,

Are the anatomical orientation labels for your image correct, when viewed in FSLeyes? If so, you should be able to re-orient the image (without modifying the data) by running the fslreorient2std command on your images.

Hello,

Hi Blanca

 

The wls option is not a requirement for fitting multi-shell data, it is simply a method for dealing with particularly noisy data. The kurtosis option is more relevant for multi-shell, as without it the tensor model can provide quite a bad fit to the data.

The bash script “drB” is certainly being written, though, and in the specified directory too. I’m going to attach it here.

Maybe you happen to have another genius idea?

Hi Jaël,
If a random set of calls is failing each time, this may be due to the fsl_sub shell plugin trying to run too many jobs simultaneously, can you try running:

export FSLSUB_PARALLEL=2

Just before the dual_regression call and see if that changes anything? If 2 works then you could potentially increase to 3/4 etc for future analyses.

Hope this helps,
Kind Regards
Matthew


Hello,

I converted MR images from DICOM to NIfTI. While scrolling through the images in FSLeyes, I noticed that the 'wrong' planes were responding when using the voxel location panel. The orientations as displayed in the overlay information seem to be different. How can I fix this?

Storage order: radiological
X voxel orientation: anterior-posterior
Y voxel orientation: inferior-superior
Z voxel orientation: left-right
X world orientation: left-right
Y world orientation: posterior-anterior
Z world orientation: inferior-superior

Thanks and regards,
Aleta

Hi there, 

Could you please help me install FSL on my computer? I use windows and I'm installing FSL using Ubuntu (I used this installation guide:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNp3lyP57rw) - but I still keep getting this error (please refer screenshot below). I'm not an ubuntu user so I'd appreciate any help - not sure what's wrong. I can even get on a call if needed. 

Screenshot 1:

Dear FSL experts,

I am not quite sure if I have an issue regarding the output of randomise. I am conducting a regular activity as well as a PPI analysis using task based fMRI. Three groups are compared using randomise. Conducting a one sample t test to test whether the task works and significantly activates the regions of interest, irrespective of group, reveals the following results: minimum z statistic of 2.770329 and maximum z statistic of 3.540119.For some reason are the connectivity maps showing similar stats: minimum z statistic of 2.726552 and a maximum z statistic of 3.540119. Thresholds of the same analysis with a different seed are: minimum z statistic of 2.706481 and a maximum z statistic of 3.540119.

1. Why is the lower threshold set on approximately 2.7, although being prespecified as 3.1 in the GUI?

2. Why is the upper threshold limited to 3.540119?

3. Furthermore, a zstat NIFTI in the stats directory of the activity analysis is showing large areas of zeros instead of floating numbers. This is not the case in the results of the PPI analyses, which also seems kind of odd to me.


All analyses are set up using the FEAT GUI.

The log is showing the following commands for the thresholding in the activity analysis (one sample t test):

Has anyone observed something similar or could provide an explanation for these results?

Help would be much appreciated, so thank you in advance!

Hi Rob, 

I believe that you need to make changes at several sub-folders, such as, 
~/.fsleyes/luts/ 
/site-packages/fsleyes/assets/luts/  
/site-packages/fsleyes/assets/colormaps/ 
/site-packages/fsleyes/displaycontext/

After the above changes, you need to sudo chmod a+x $FSLDIR. It is better to add your own colormaps after the default ones.  

Best wishes,

Shanrong

Dear All,

We are currently recruiting for a PhD student to start in September 2023 as part of a Precision Medicine Doctoral Training Partnership cohort (https://www.ed.ac.uk/usher/precision-medicine/about-the-programme/programme-structure). Unfortunately, due to funding restrictions only candidates with Home fees status (typically UK citizens or EU citizens with (pre)settled) can be considered. If you may be interested or know of someone who may be please let me know.

Best wishes,

Michael Stringer

Research Fellow in Magnetic Resonance Imaging, University of Edinburgh

Determining cerebral small vessel function and flow in small vessel disease

Supervisors: Dr Michael Stringer, Dr Michael Thrippleton, Prof Joanna Wardlaw

Description: Small vessel disease (SVD) causes many cases of stroke and dementias.1 While what causes SVD is poorly understood, in patients with higher SVD severity their blood vessels are less responsiveness to increased demand.1 We can measure cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), how well blood vessels respond to increased demand, using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans during hypercapnic gas challenge. However, existing methods to calculate CVR have several limitations.2 More accurate quantification would improve understanding of SVD pathophysiology and patient stratification.1

In this project, the successful student will:

support acquisition of brain MRI scans and further their MRI physics knowledge
develop novel CVR methods to analyse several large existing datasets with extensive contextual data
learn about clinical brain imaging, how scans are interpreted and clinical presentations of SVD
expand their statistical skills to run complex multifactorial analyses
develop their scientific writing and presentation skills

Small Vessel Diseases Research Group

The post will be based in the Small Vessel Diseases Research Group (Prof Joanna Wardlaw) linked with the Row Fogo Centre for Research into Ageing and the Brain and UK DRI: UK Dementia Research Institute at the University of Edinburgh. The group also has exceptional links with other world leading SVD research centres in the UK and internationally. 

Precision Medicine Doctoral Training Programme

The Precision Medicine Doctoral Training Programme is a 3.5-4 year PhD programme funded by the Medical Research Council, University of Edinburgh and University of Glasgow. It trains PhD in both quantitative skills and their application to medical data sources giving the interdisciplinary skills needed to put precision medicine into practice.
