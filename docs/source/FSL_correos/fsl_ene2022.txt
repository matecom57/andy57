Dear Paul,

Thank you for clarifying that we do not have to install cuda toolkit.

It's my bad that I named the file as 'cuda-toolkit-102.sh'. The script actually installs cuda driver for cuda 10.2, not cuda toolkit.

"sudo apt-get -y install --no-install-recommends cuda-10-2"

I want to make sure that the file (cuda-10-2) is the one I need to install. Am I right?

Best regards,

Kiyotaka

Hi Alessandra and Kiyotaka,

The FSL wiki GPU page is out of date. As of FSL 6.0.6, you do not need to install the CUDA toolkit to run eddy_cuda (the 10.2 toolkit is statically linked into the binary) - you only need to install a CUDA driver.

Alessandra, are you running eddy_cuda directly, or are you submitting it to a cluster via fsl_sub?

Hi FSL Team,

I am running a general linear model with parametric modulation for my first level analyses. However, there are some trials where participants did not input any rating. What value should I input (in the third column of the timing file) for these trials in order for FSL to run? I've initially put NaN, and that produces a problematic design.fsf file.

Thank you!

Best,
Jo

Dear Alessandra,

In order to use eddy_cuda10.2 in Ubuntu 20.04, you need to install CUDA 10.2.

The trick is that you need to use Ubuntu 18.04 repository for CUDA (not Ubuntu 20.04 repository)

Attached is a script which installs CUDA 10.2 for Ubuntu 20.04.

I myself use Ubuntu 20.04 and I wrote this script for myself.

Save this script in Download and run this script sets up NVIDIA repository and install CUDA 10.2.

After reboot, you can use eddy_cuda 10.2.

Hope this helps,

Kiyotaka

Dear FSL experts,

I intend to use the FSL_HCP1065_FA_1mm template in our processing streams.

I noticed that the cortical rim in the FA template does not fully align with the cortical rim in the MNI152_T1_1mm_brain template. See page 1, 2 and 3 in the linked pdf below. This seems especially to be the case for the upper part of the brain (possibly biased to the right hemisphere), as well as occipital and frontal regions.

I guess this might be due to the FA template containing non-brain/CSF voxel that are “squeezed” to fit the MNI brain template, which contains minimal non-brain/CSF voxels. At least with respect to the cortical rim. Non-brain/CSF voxels in the T1 template are clearly apparent in medial temporal, circle of Willis, optical nerves, sigmoid sinus, brainstem, and cerebellar regions.

Consequences are likely minor, when sticking to FA MNI standard space, depending on the brain mask quality of to be warped individual subject FA volumes and employed warping strategies. 

Nevertheless, ensuring a better fit between FA (MD, …) and T1 MNI templates would likely reduce possible “noise” in reported results in the literature, as MNI coordinates in T1 MNI standard space not necessary would match those in FA MNI standard space.
 
Please your thoughts on this

Hello,

While using BET at the MRI graduate programme, we realised that there is a bug with the bet options. Running a command with capitalised options returns the error message "cannot open file: -" (screenshot below). However it does look like an output is being produced.

This only occurs with capitalised options (I tested it with -B and -R).  Other options seem to work fine. I am running version 6.0.5.2:dc6f4207 on a macbook with OS Ventura.  I checked with Rick Lange during the practical and we tested in other computers and it seems to be an mac OS problem. It works fine in the previous OS version.

Hope this helps.

Best wishes,
David Berhanu

Hi David,

This is a known issue on Ventura - Apple have changed the command-line interface of the "dc" UNIX program - a number of FSL tools depend on this command, and so will crash on Ventura.

We are updating the FSL tools for the next release, but as an interim work-around you can install a wrapper for the dc program into $FSLDIR/bin/ (or $FSLDIR/share/fsl/bin/ for FSL 6.0.6 and newer).

1. Download the attached file
2. Run these commands in a terminal. You may need to prefix the second and third commands with "sudo", which will prompt you for your administrator password.

    cd $FSLDIR/bin/
    unzip ~/Downloads/dc.zip
    chmod a+x ./dc

Hi Nooshin,

I'm guessing that you have FSL 6.0.5.2 installed. You should be able to fix this issue by upgrading to the latest FSL version (6.0.6.2), by following the steps at https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FslInstallation

Hi Diederick,

This sounds like an issue with the module command, e.g. improper use of the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable. The FSL binaries as we release them should not need LD_LIBRARY_PATH (or simiilar) set - you will need to consult with your system administrators.

Hi Lin,

The "expanded functional image" option will cause a three-stage registration to take place (functional -> expanded functional -> structural). This option is useful for partial-FOV data, where one full-FOV volume has been acquired.

The "alternative reference image" option will result in two-stage registration, using the alternative reference in place of the functional data. This option should only be used if the alternative reference is defined in the same space as the functional data.

Hi Edward,

I have reproduced the crash on one particular system (A100), and will hopefully have some time to look into it further next week. Strangely though, it appears to run fine on another system (Tesla K80), so you may have success if you can run it on a system with a different GPU.

At the same page, it says:
If an FSL GPU program is not distributed for the CUDA version you have, it is also possible to compile from source with the correct development environment configuration (instructions to come).

It would be great to have such instructions!

Hi FSL community,

I have succesfully installed FSL 6.0.6.2 on by Ubuntu 20.04 distribution. I checked the cuda version, and there is a 10.2 version, therefore I set up the link eddy_cuda >> eddy_cuda10.2, as illustrated in the FSL/EDDY user guide (for eddy_cuda 8.0 and 9.1):
ln -sf ${FSLDIR}/bin/eddy_cuda9.1 ${FSLDIR}/bin/eddy_cuda.

I am running eddy on my diffusion data with the command:
eddy_cuda --imain=rawDWIs.nii.gz --mask=posb0_u_brain.nii.gz --acqp=acqparams.txt --index=index.txt --bvecs=bvecs.bvec --bvals=bvals.bval --topup=/home/stella/Documents/OUTPUTS/topup --out=eddy_unwarped_images --verbose

and this is the output I get:

Reading images
 ????U

EDDY::: Eddy failed with message ??G??????U

Do you have any idea on why a proper error message doesn' show up?

I have tried miswriting input names, such as rawDW1s.nii.gz instead of rawDWIs.nii.gz, and it catches them correctly, showing:
Image Exception : #63 :: No image files match: rawDW1s
Image Exception : #22 :: Failed to read volume rawDW1s.nii.gz
Error : No image files match: rawDW1s
 ????/OV
Terminating program

It is curious to have such symbols shown in the terminal. Could this depend on the CUDA drivers somehow?

Thanks for your help,

Alessandra Stella
