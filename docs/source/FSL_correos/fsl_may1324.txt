 I checked it. Indeed, I do not have the write access on that file. Thank your for your help.

I met a problem when I used FSL tools on the Canada Alliance (https://ccdb.alliancecan.ca/). I wanted to run the BET function of FSL. The terminal command line is below:
      bet <input> <output> [options]

and below is my command:

      bet /lustre06/project/6087271/CanCam/cc700/mri/pipeline/release004/BIDS_20190411/anat/sub-CC110033/anat/sub-CC110033_T1w.nii.gz /lustre06/project/6087271/CanCam/cc700/mri/pipeline/release004/BIDS_20190411/anat/sub-CC110033/anat/sub-CC110033_T1w_brain

  But it failed and prompted me to:
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'NiftiIO::NiftiException'
  what():  Error: cant open file /lustre06/project/6087271/CanCam/cc700/mri/pipeline/release004/BIDS_20190411/anat/sub-CC110033/anat/sub-CC110033_T1w_brain.nii.gz

  Besides, I am sure that the output file path is correct because os.path.exists('/lustre06/project/6087271/CanCam/cc700/mri/pipeline/release004/BIDS_20190411/anat/sub-CC110033/anat/sub-CC110033_T1w.nii.gz') returns True.

Postdoc position available in Marseille France (deadline May 26th)! 

Research in our group concerns the developmental and neural underpinnings of non-verbal communication. We are particularly interested in the interpersonal alignment of actions and emotions, and how this may change at the time of adolescence in relation to changes in the body and in self-perception. We welcome applications for a post-doc position to develop a project along this line, with possible collaboration with other members of ILCB (ilcb.fr). This project could build on Hi Matt,

First, a general warning: you never want to apply any transforms to the bedpostX output, nor any non-linear transforms to the diffusion MRI data.

Fortunately, you don't have to, because any outputs of probtrackx (including --matrix1) will be in the same space as you provide the masks, not the same space as the diffusion data. So, just provide the masks in MNI space and provide probtrackx with the transforms between MNI space and the diffusion space (using the --xfm and --invxfm flags). If you use the same MNI masks across subjects, this will ensure you have comparable matrix results across subjects.

Best wishes,

Michiel
