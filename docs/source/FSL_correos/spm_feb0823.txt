Dear SPM community,
We had started to work with a brand new 3T VIDA scanner from Siemens, with an XA31 operating system. We have acquired fMRI data using the 64 channels coil with various acceleration parameters.
Eyeballing the data there is a massive drop in the signal in deep structures, especially the Putamen. Though it still gives 10 folds more signal than air. When analyzing the data using the default set-up, SPM creates a mask that does include the Putamen.
Any tips, suggestion on how to overcome this problem?
 
Kind regards


Dear All

Please share this opportunity in your networks.

An exciting postdoc opportunity has come up here at the University of Sheffield.

Short project summary below. Anyone interested can contact me directly at cheryl.ruse@sheffield.ac.uk

"The University of Sheffield’s ex vivo group has successfully been testing the feasibility, methodology, and logistics of delivering ex vivo screening in a UoS/NHS environment in bladder, renal, and glioblastoma cancers from patient recruitment to endpoint analysis. This image-based drug screening platform is designed to predict patient response to oncology treatment from a biopsy or surgical tissue taken directly from the patient.
 
We are currently using high resolution high content microscopy to image patient samples at single cell resolution. We utilise nucleus stains and immunofluorescence (IF) markers for cell population segmentation resulting in >6000 images, 16Gb, per patient. These images are then analysed to quantify viability for each cell population, resulting in predicted drug sensitivity profiles against the patients’ tumours. We wish to develop an automated image analysis pipeline, but also try and utilise more of the data captured in the images including cell morphology, cell cycle staging, cell-on-cell interactions, nuclei morphology to gain more meaningful biological data and fully interpret the data captured in the images.

We have 1 year’s funding for a postdoc to start to develop an image analysis pipeline working towards a supervised learning platform. Unfortunately, this funding expires in March 2024, therefore we are looking for some to start ASAP on the project. Ideally, we would like an individual with image analysis and computational programming experience."


Kind regards

I am running a second level analysis, but SPM is returning an error during the sphericity correction.
Specifically, "Check Data: No Significant Voxels". All subsequent steps in the analysis fail after this.

I suspected that I had not turned off implicit masking so I re-ran the analysis setting implicit masking to 0.
I used the following code for this:
level2Batch{1}.spm.stats.factorial_design.masking.im = 0;

I confirmed that masking.im = 0 in the actual batch file. But I still got the same error.

I looked into the SPM.mat file generated by the second level analysis and saw that SPM.xM.I = 1, and SPM.xM.xs.Implicit_masking = 'Yes:NaN's treated as missing'

Based on this, it seems like implicit masking is still engaged, but I am not sure how to turn it off.

1) Am I correct that implicit masking is still turned on?
2) How can I disable it?

Thank you.

Sincerely,
Brandon Ashinoff

Dear experts,

I would like to do a four-group comparison in the PEB scheme.
I have three patient groups (let's say SCZ, MDD, and ASD) and one healthy control group.

First, I would like to know the effect of being patient.
Each group has two participants, and the order of the group is the following; SCZ, MDD, ASD, and control.
So, the design matrix could be the following to find the effect of being patient (the common effect of being patient).
The first column is the effect of being controls, the second is being patients.
1 1
1 1
1 1
1 1
1 1
1 1
1 0
1 0

Then, I would like to know if the following matrix can work to find the common effect of being patients and the differences between each patient group and control.
The first column is the effect of being controls, the second is being patients, the third is SCZ (SCZ vs control), the fourth is MDD (MDD vs control), and the fifth is ASD (ASD vs control).
1 1 1 0 0
1 1 1 0 0
1 1 0 1 0
1 1 0 1 0
1 1 0 0 1
1 1 0 0 1
1 0 0 0 0
1 0 0 0 0

I also like to find differences between patient groups after regressing out the effect of being patients (the common effect of being patients).
Does the following matrix work for this?
The first column controls, the second is patients, the third is SCZ vs MDD, fourth is MDD vs ASD.
1 1 1 0  
1 1 1 0
1 1-1 1
1 1-1 1
1 1 0-1
1 1 0-1  
1 0 0 0
1 0 0 0

Then, run the second matrix to find out the difference between SCZ vs ASD, in which participants in the order ASD, SDZ, MDD, and control.
1 1 1 0  
1 1 1 0
1 1-1 1
1 1-1 1
1 1 0-1
1 1 0-1  
1 0 0 0
1 0 0 0

Any advice and comments are highly appreciated.

Best wishes,
Yuko

To get this to work, you'd need to do all the image processing with left-right symmetric tissue probability maps, so that under the null hypothesis, the  left and right sides of the spatially normalised images can be assumed to be identical.

Creating left-right symmetric TPMs can be achieved by averaging the TPM.nii released with SPM with a left-right flipped version of itself.  This should eliminate any left-right bias from the tissue segmentation.  This could be done for the six volumes in the TPM.nii, using ImCalc and the expression:

    (i1+flipud(i1))/2

If you plan to use Dartel, then you'd need to have the original "imported" rc1 and rc2 images, as well as left-right flipped versions of them.  Without this, the population average created by Dartel would not be left-right symmetric.

Rather than Dartel, you may wish to try the Shoot toolbox.  The interface should (I hope) be relatively intuitive for anyone who has previously used Dartel.  With Shoot, you can edit the spm12/toolbox/Shoot/spm_shoot_defaults.m file, setting d.issym   = true. This will force Shoot to align everything to a left-right symmetric template.

Then, after all the image processing, you could create left-right flipped versions of the smoothed spatially normalised images with which to compare the unflipped versions.

As ever, it might be worth double checking that the Shoot or Dartel templates are exactly symmetric, otherwise it could mess with the null hypothesis.  For example, the way that spatial gradients are computed for trilinear  interpolation might introduce tiny asymmetries.

Best regards,
-John

Subject: [SPM] Regarding VBM - Hemispheric differences in same subjects
 
⚠ Caution: External sender


Dear SPM community

I want to run a VBM based analysis where I want to compare if there are any hemispheric differences within-subject and also within-group. I am facing issues to do that, for eg., how to compare the two hemispheres in the same subject? Is this possible with SPM-VBM or should I be using CAT12?

Any help would be appreciated.

>1. Where do you apply the explicit mask, when defining the model (i.e. “Specify 1st-level” module in SPM)
here

>or when looking at the results (i.e., “Results” module in SPM)?
in results, the mask hide the results only

>If it is the former, then SPM should screen those voxels that exceed the threshold (i.e., 0.4) within your explicit mask, right?
no ; there is a confusion.
masking procedure in the 1st level analysis is done to eliminate voxels of no interest from the analysis, and so, decrease the multiple comparison problem in the following statistical step.
the implicit mask (functional) is not an image but a procedure thresholding the functional images to keep only voxels above 40%of the mean intensity value (or 80% by default).
the explicit mask does’nt depend on the functional images but only on a mask image that you give to the model. You can choose “inclusive or exclusive” option, meaning that you want the analysis inside or outside the mask image.

I choose both masks.

>2. Considering that functional images are generally smoothed, some researchers suggest smoothing the explicit mask as well. Do you agree with a such opinion?

No. but for my anatomical mask, I’d prefer to have a low threshold of the proba of grey matter (often 50%).

If you are doing group analysis, an alternative is to functionally mask the individual data (1st level) and anatomical restrict the analysis at the group level. With the fmriprep processing, the anatomical normalization is very good, so the averaged grey matter of the group is still lovely and so you can threshold this mean image to have a group anatomical mask for the group level, which represent the best mean  probability to have GM in each voxel….

Dear Sara,

the CAt12 tool Threshold & Transform T-maps allows to convert to correlation coefficients if you have a regression design. The slope can be obtained by the beta estimate for the column where your regressor is defined. Let's assume your regressor is in the 2nd column then beta_0001.nii is the beta estimate that corresponds to the slope.

Best,

Christian
