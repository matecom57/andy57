Hi Kikuko,

This is indeed a challenging problem, there is another approach you could try to get rid of the issue of the distortion corrections:

- register your subject's FA to an FA template derived also from the dHCP: https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.661704/full

- register this FA template (using the T2w) to the Schuh low res template

- concatenate both registrations into one and apply it to the subject's FA

I would use ANTs for both registrations and then transform them to FSL format.

I hope this helps.

Best regards,

Manuel

Study Coordinator: Full-time Paid Postbaccalaureate Research Assistant
University of Maryland, College Park, MD

Candidates are being considered for a NIMH/NIAAA-funded post-baccalaureate Study Coordinator position in the laboratory of Dr. Alex Shackman in the Department of Psychology at the University of Maryland at College Park.

The overarching mission of the lab is to have a deep impact on the fields of affective and clinical/translational neuroscience. To that end, we do our best to perform innovative studies that can lead to significant discoveries, to disseminate our discoveries as widely as possible, and to mentor trainees to become top-notch scientists.

Under the supervision of Dr. Shackman and other senior staff, the Study Coordinator will play a central role in ongoing NIAAA- and NIMH-sponsored projects aimed at understanding the neurocomputational architecture of fear and anxiety and its role in adult anxiety and alcohol use disorders. This position will provide opportunities to gain experience with neuroimaging (fMRI), smartphone ecological momentary assessment (EMA), and structured clinical interviews. This is an exciting opportunity to receive top-notch mentorship and establish a competitive research record—including publications and conference presentations—in preparation for graduate training in clinical psychology, affective neuroscience, or medicine. You can learn more about former Study Coordinators on our Alumni page.

This is a 1-year position that is renewable, contingent on performance and funding. Duties may include, but are not limited to, subject recruitment and scheduling; data acquisition, processing, and archiving; study/database management; general grant and lab administration; and manuscript/figure preparation. Some duties (e.g. MRI sessions) will occur during evening or weekend hours.

Applicants should send: (1) a Cover Letter summarizing relevant experiences, skills, and interests—please be specific and concrete; (2) a CV/Resume, (3) relevant Transcripts (unofficial copies are fine), and (4) Contact Information for 2-4 references. Please send your materials to Dominique Ewing (dewing1@umd.edu). Formal letters of recommendation are not required for the initial application and will only be requested for short-listed applicants.

This is a fantastic opportunity to live in and explore DC, MD, and Northern VA!
