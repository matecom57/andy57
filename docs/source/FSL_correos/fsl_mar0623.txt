Hi Michael and Catarina,
Thank you for this thread. As a follow up question to you both and anyone else who might have expertise with using fieldmaps with 3D GRASE: Do we have to take the fact that GRASE is a hybrid between FSE and EPI into consideration when applying a previously obtained fieldmap in BASIL? I have obtained the echo spacing value from the siemens protocol pdf (0.5ms) for the 3D GRASE PASL implementation on our scanner. Am i correct in assuming that this echo spacing value is an overestimation of the actual off-resonance phase accrual that the GRASE acquisition will actually experience? If this assumption is correct then is there a robust mathematical approach for adjusting this echo-spacing value for use in BASIL from some of the GRASE parameters?
Thank you for any advice on this.
Best

Hi all,
I' m trying to model a mixed-effects model with random slope and random intercept in PALM.
However, a rank deficiency error appeared when I was running PALM, I suspected I didn't create the correct design matrix or contrast. I hope you experts can tell me how to create a design matrix with random slope and random intercept in PALM, any suggestion would be greatly appreciated.
 
Suppose I only have 2 subjects and 2 factors, each at 2 levels. The data in my 4D file looks like:
Sub1 A1B1
Sub2 A1B1
Sub1 A1B2
Sub2 A1B2
Sub1 A2B1
Sub2 A2B1
Sub1 A2B1
Sub2 A2B2
Sub2 A2B2

Here are the formula used in MATLAB’s function fitlme:
Y ~ A + B + A*B + age + (1 + A + B | subject)
The effect A and B are set to random slope, each subject has random intercept. Then I tried to create design matrix used in PALM, the fixed effect part looks like:
A1B1    A1B2    A2B1    A2B2    age
1       0       0       0       21
1       0       0       0       26
0       1       0       0       23
0       1       0       0       24
0       0       1       0       25
0       0       1       0       27
0       0       0       1       28
0       0       0       1       23
The random effect part looks like:
1       0       1       0       0       0
0       0       0       1       0       1
1       0       0       0       0       0
0       0       0       1       0       0
1       1       1       0       0       0
0       0       0       1       1       1
1       1       0       0       0       0
0       0       0       1       1       0
The contrast looks like:
1       1       -1      -1      0       0       0       0       0       0       0
1       -1      1       -1      0       0       0       0       0       0       0
1       -1      -1      1       0       0       0       0       0       0       0
The command running PALM looks like:
palm
-i 4D.func.gii
-s L.midthickness.32k_fs_LR.surf.gii
-d design_matrix.mat
-t T_contrast.con
-o test
-n 1000
-accel gamma
-T
-C 3.29
-Cstat extent
-twotail
-saveuncorrected
-savemask
-saveparametric
-savemax
Then a rank deficiency error appeared when I was running PALM, the error message is:
Error using palm_takeargs>testrank (line 2784)
The following contrasts try to test regressor(s) also fully represented by
by nuisance variable(s), but such tests are not possible (rank deficiency):
- Design 1, Contrast 1, at least 1 regressors
- Design 1, Contrast 2, at least 1 regressors
- Design 1, Contrast 3, at least 1 regressors

All the best,

Xiangyu

Michael,

thank you very much for your insightful comments. Actually, there is a difference listed in the parameter card between ACQ voxels (3.75 x 3.75 x 6) and the Recon voxel size (3 x 3 x 6). This can be certainly an issue, but the slice thickness is the same. For that, I don’t know how this affects the PSF. Overall, the variability is much higher in the pvgm image compared to the uncorrected CBF image. I still have the impression that voxels with low GM portion will be excessively augmented, when the uncorrected CBF value is already quite high (e.g. initial: 64 pvgm: 0.35 corrected: 156). Therefore some thresholding might be useful.

One simple solution would be to calculate the CBF values with and without PV correction and compare the results.

Testing: A Hybrid JASP Workshop
 
July 15–16, 2023

The JASP Team is excited to announce that registration for our annual two-day hybrid Amsterdam workshop is now open. The workshop will be happening both on-site and via Zoom and it takes place on July 15–16, 2023. Below is a summary of the program. For more information on program and fees visit the workshop website: https://jasp-stats.org/workshop
 

Event Description
The main purpose of this workshop is to familiarize participants with key Bayesian concepts in hypothesis testing. Concrete examples illustrate how to compute, report, and interpret Bayesian hypothesis tests for popular statistical models such as correlation, regression, t-test, ANOVA, and contingency tables. To facilitate the learning process we use JASP, a program whose attractive graphical user interface allows us to focus on core Bayesian concepts and principles, unburdened by the need to explain the detailed workings of an unfamiliar software program such as WinBUGS.
 

Target Audience
This workshop is relevant to psychologists, economists, biologists, and generally any student or researcher who wishes to draw conclusions from empirical data. No background in Bayesian statistics is required. At the end of this workshop, participants should be able to carry out statistical analyses in JASP, interpret the output, and report the results.

Hi Alex,

This suggests that xtract did not run without issue. Have you looked at the output of xtract for any example subjects, particularly those failing with xtract_stats?

I’m guessing they will be missing some tract files (you’re looking for the densityNorm.nii.gz files). For subjects with the empty mask error, open some tracts and see what they look like. Do you look like the tract as expected? Or is it an empty nifti file?

Once we verify whether it’s xtract failing (i.e. the nifti files are empty/non-existent), or xtract_stats failing, we can dig into the problem more easily.

Thanks,
Shaun.

Dear FSL experts,

I'm running a diffusion tractography on a relatively large dataset, and having run preprocessing and xtract without issue, am now trying to generate the tract statistics using xtract_stats. When running this on the vast majority of subjects, I receive the message "Couldn't find images for [tract name]" on a number of tracts. Some others show the "ERROR: Empty mask image" message instead. I've tried re-running both registration and xtract (using scripts and commands in terminal, and batch array scripts on a cluster in case of any differences) but seem to be running into the same issues. Strangely, after re-running xtract on a number of subjects, xtract_stats ran just fine on a couple of the ones that showed errors previously, but many more are still showing them.

I can't seem to find anything about the "couldn't find images" message anywhere on the forum and can't seem to figure out why it keeps cropping up. Any help or suggestions you could give would be a huge help. I can show my scripts/commands if needed.

Kind regards,
Alex Sheehan

Hi Michael,

Thanks for your response. Yes, the mask.nii.gz generated automatically is not complete and cuts off the inferior parts of the brain. Could a simple fslmaths command to binarize the asl input image be alright for use as a native space mask?

I'm guessing the native space grey matter and white matter masks are generated by overlaying this brain mask with the segmented structural image in struc.anat?

Thanks

Dear Martin, 

I'm running FSL 6.0.6.2 on WSL. The error occurred first with FSL 6.0.4 which I updated due to the error after I had run the program several times without any error.
Thank you very much for your support.

HI Christian, from the error you're getting  it looks like a failure to find the oxford_asl_roi_stats script.

Could you let me know what FSL version you are using and what platform you're running on (Mac, Linux, WSL etc). I will look into why this is happening.

Thanks,

Hello FSL experts,

I'm trying to run randomise as a 2 x 4 between-subjects ANOVA. I have two groups with four conditions each. I would like to examine both the interaction effect and the main effect. Basically Group*Condition, Condition1(group1-group2) in randomise. I have done t-test in randomise before but for this 2x4 between subject Anova, I don't know how to set the design matrix and contracts.

Thank you in advance,
Mohammadreza

p.s.
I start thinking about the maximum intensity voxel and the Peak voxel (which should actually ALSO be a maximum intensity of its kind) based on the distribution of the data = voxels in the cluster.

If we have bell-shaped (i.e. normal) distribution, then we will have the maximum intensity voxel match the Peak voxel.
If it is non-normal distribution, then the median will be = "the maximum intensity voxel" from the cluster command, and the Peak voxel = will be the REALLY REAL maximum intensity within this cluster. And here, they will point to different MNI coordinates.

Ashwati,

This sounds like the brain mask is incomplete in some cases. The output should include the automatically generated mask and that would be the first thing I would check. If that is the problem you might need to investigate ways of generating your own brain has for subjects where the automated method fails.

Hi Ralf,

The extrapolation command that is used in asl_calib is:

asl_file --data=calib_ero --ntis=1 --mask=mask --extrapolate --neighbour=5 --out=m0map

Here calib_ero is an eroded M0 image and mask is the non-eroded mask. It should extrapolate to the edge of the mask using median filtering. Perhaps adding the --ntis=1 would help with your command?

If this doesn't work, let me know the error message and I'll see what I can figure out.

Best regards,
Martin

Subject: [FSL] PCASL partial volume correction
 
Dear ASL team, I'm analyzing ASL data (FSL version: 6.0.4) from Philips using a 3D PCASL sequence with GRASE readout. We have an inplane resolution of 3x3 mm and a slice thickness of 6 mm. We selected voxel-wise calibration using an M0 image. The images were distortion corrected using a separate M0 image with reversed PE direction. For the segmentation we run fsl_anat. I have a question regarding the partial volume correction. In particular, in voxels with a quite low gray matter portion the correction produces relative high CBF values (gm portion 0.1 to 0.3 or 0.4) that seems to me unrealistic (up to 150 or even higher). The values corresponds roughly to uncorrected CBF values divided by GM portion. What is the exact formula for the calculation? Does it make sense to threshold the perfusion images with more stringent criteria, like 0.3? Attached is an image with uncorrected CBF values at the top (scaled 0 – 100), the pvgm_inasl image in the middle (scaled 0-1) and the PV corrected image at the bottom (scaled 0 to 100). The most noticeable differences are in the middle frontal area, lower temporal areas and at the edges. Should I use a cut-off for CBF values beyond a certain threshold (i.e. 150)? The second question relates to the extrapolation of the M0 image using asl_file (partial volume correction at the edges). The following command does not work. asl_file --data=M0n.nii.gz --extrapolate --out=M0n_extrapol.nii asl_file expects a time series or a difference image, but not a M0 image. How can I do this?

Hi Tugan,

Apologies for this - the bug has been fixed for the next upcoming FSL release. I think the error message about being unable to determine the image shape is also due to get_data->get_fdata - this is used in two places in oxford_asl/gui/__init__.py so if you can find and change the second instance as well it should work. Let me know if you have any trouble doing this.

Best regards,
Martin

Subject: [FSL] BASIL asl_gui input image loading problem
 
Hi everyone,

I have been using asl_gui for sometime and everything worked without a problem. I recently updated to the latest fsl version and it is having problems loading the asl image series. When i try to load the image series (input image), an error message shows up in the terminal (using ubuntu 22.04) complaining that nibabel depracated the get_data(). I replaced the get_data() with get_fdata() as recommended in the error message. Then I can see that it reads the file and the correct number of volumes shows up in the lower right corner. But a red error message shows up at the bottom of the gui complaining that it cannot determine the size of the image. "%s - failed to read data shape - check image file is not corrupted". I was uploading these files into asl_gui before, and i tried a bunch of images that I processed before. So, I know that they are not corrupted. I can also view them with fsleyes.

I also tried reading shape of the file myself in the fslpython environment using shape = nib.load(fname).get_fdata().shape, and  it reads the image and gets the shape correctly. So, I don't know where it fails.

I will be grateful if anyone can suggest some solutions.

best wishes,
-Tugan

Ralf,

There is not an explicit formula for partial volume correction in BASIL: the voxelwise signal formula is the sum of a WM and GM perfusion component weighted by the input partial volume estimate, but the way the perfusion values are calculated include a spatial prior which depends on the values in the neighbouring voxels (it is broadly equivalent to the approach taken by the linear regression method, but adaptive based on the data). That said, for partial volume correction I would not be surprise if the output perfusion values are roughly the scaled version of the non-corrected values, since the main contribution in any given voxel is the GM perfusion - the WM is smaller and the CSF zero.

Of course, all of this raises the question as to why you are seeing unexpectedly large values. Apart from the normal presumption that GM is 60 everywhere (based on techniques that also suffer from partial volume effects), any microvascular/arterial contamination in the data will be amplified by the PV correction. Since you have GRASE data a possible issue could be a mismatch between the voxel size for your matrix and the ’true’ resolution of the data. The correction assumes that the partial volumes reflect those that causes the signal mixing in the ASL data. If there is a mismatch in the resolution assumed based on the data matrix and the actual resolution of the point spread function then the partial voluming might be greater in thhe ASL data than it appears in the partial volume map, the consequence would be greater amplification of the GM values. I suspect this could be relevant as we know that GRASE readouts often have a PSF that isn’t matched so well to the matrix.In fact, I think you can see a difference in the inferior-superior direction between the (non-corrected) ASL perfusion and the GM partial volumes that would fit with this.

If I am right, thresholding won’t fix the issue. Although you might inherently not trust voles with low PV and/or extremely high perfusion and thus seek to exclude them for the reasons outlined.

Hi Matt,

Thank you for your information about the version of FSL.
I have already reinstalled the FSL 6.0.6 without any problem.

Best wishes,
Lin

Hi Matthew,

Today I tried to install FSL6.0.5 again and found the same error, if though I first type the command that you recommended.
Because the HCP pipeline recommends us to use FSL 6.0.5, it seems safe to use this version when I run HCP pipelines.

Best,
Lin

ear FSL,
what is the difference between maximum intensity voxel and peak voxel? Based on my DTI analysis, they appear to be different voxels.

Here is my analysis:

I have a statistically significant contrast, and with the cluster command, I get:

Two clusters: with 166, and with 194 voxels.
+ MNI coordinates.

FSL Wiki says that these MNI coordinates point to the maximum intensity value in the cluster, which I interpret as a specific voxel which I call a "maximum intensity voxel".
("MAX: the value of the maximum "intensity" within the cluster (e.g. the maximum z-statistic if the input was a z-statistic image").

However, I need the Peak voxel that best correlates with my cognitive tests (as the maximum intensity voxel does not give me a good p-value). Thus, I use (cluster, fslmaths and fslmeants) to get all the individual voxels within the 194-voxel cluster. I do a simple correlation between the cognitive test results and the individual patients' voxels and, based on the highest p-value, get my Peak voxel.

However, the coordinates are different from the maximum intensity voxel. Then, what is the maximum intensity voxel?

Thank you and cheers,
Said

Hello,

I have been running BASIL on 3D PASL images and I find that for some subjects the region analysis is complete whereas for other subjects consistently inferior brain regions are excluded. I looked at the perfusion image and it clearly shows the exclusion of almost half of the brain, thus the values are also missing for these regions of the brain.

I'm not sure why this would be the case since the commands work totally fine for some subjects but not others. The raw image data is fine too so I'm not sure where the problem lies.

Could you please advise?

Thank you so much!

Hello Everyone,

In my dataset, the fix_training. RData file is generated for all the other subjects; however, for two subjects, the. Rdata is not created.
I have tried the following:
- Re-ran the feat preprocessing thrice.
- Checked the hand_labels_noise.txt for commas, space, and brackets and made sure that there was an empty final line after that.
- Checked the.Rlog file which shows:   Error in knn(train.data[, -dim(train.data)[2]], train.data[, -dim(train.data)[2]],  :
  no missing values are allowed
  Execution halted

Please take a look at the attached .Rlog file & sample hand_labels_noise.txt

Looking forward to your response!
Thanks in advance!

Best,
Priyanka

Hi Shen,

Did you rename/move the FSL directory after installing? The error refers to both /opt/fsl6/, and /opt/fsl/. FSL directories are not presently relocatable, so it is not possible to move the directory after installation.

Dear FSL community,


The Brain Imaging, Development, and Genetics (BRIDGE) lab, part of Stanford University’s Division of Brain Sciences, is seeking two full-time Postdoctoral Fellows in brain imaging and/or human genetic modeling. Ideal candidates will have a solid neuroscience, neuroimaging, and/or human genetics background.

BRIDGE focuses on neuropsychiatric disorders, specifically those associated with RASopathies, such as Noonan syndrome and neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1). In our NIH-funded research, we employ three unique approaches: 1. Taking a genetics-first approach, we study children with known genetic conditions who exhibit attention problems, irritability, and deficits in social cognition. The approach differs from traditional research, which begins with the child's symptoms. 2. We apply in-depth phenotyping of the child's brain, genes, and behavior using brain imaging, genetic testing, and behavioral assessment. 3. We use large publicly available data sets (>10K children) focusing on child brain and behavioral development. Our goal is, therefore, to uncover how genetic variation and its associated downstream pathways affect children's developmental disorders.

If interested, please see the official posting for additional details at
https://postdocs.stanford.edu/prospective/opportunities/open-postdoctoral-position-faculty-mentor-tamar-green

Thank you,
Mira Raman, Research Data Analyst

Hi,

I have just installed FSL 6.0.6.2 on my Centos 7. During the installation, I didn't get any error messages.
However, when I ran the following command in terminal:
bet my_hifi_b0 testMASK -m

I got this error message:
/opt/fsl6/bin/bet: /opt/fsl6/bin/remove_ext: /opt/fsl/bin/python3.10: bad interpreter: No such file or directory
/opt/fsl6/bin/bet failed during command:my_hifi_b0 testMASK -m

How to fix it? Thanks for helping in advance,
Shen
