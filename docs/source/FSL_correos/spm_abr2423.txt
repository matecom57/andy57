Betreff: [SPM] cluster correction in SPM
 
Hi, 
How the cluster correction is performed in SPM? What are the general principles? Are they the same than AFNI or/and FSL?
What is the script name that allows to perform the cluster correction? Is it possible to use this script on stat maps that have not been processed within SPM and are not related to a SPM.mat file?
Best,
Simon

Dear all,

Join the fun & learn new skills at Neuroscience Alliance (NEURAL) - an OHBM chapter (9-11.05.23). 

You can also test your skills during the event, compete for the stroke outcome prediction cup, and win a real cup!

Don't forget to register here -->  https://www.neurosciencealliance.org 
Location: BORDEAUX, IMN, Amphi Broca

Aim of the event
Neuroscience Alliance is a nonprofit organisation that works like a Brainhack and aims to promote interaction between scientists, developers, and artists interested in the brain. Questions may evolve around the study of brain anatomy and function using non-invasive imaging methods (e.g., MRI, EEG, MEG) and intraoperative brain mapping methods, or post-mortem dissection of the evolution of nervous systems across species, variability of brain characteristics in healthy participants, the insurgency of brain pathologies, and there is no limit to artistic reflections in any form.
Participants can bring their dataset, discuss a project, and recruit a team of collaborators on-site. Access to large, free online databases of MRI images will also be available throughout the three days to test new creative ideas.
The workshop, which incorporates all levels of expertise, is also an opportunity to learn methods, develop skills and collaborate with other participants.

Hello,

We have 5 runs with 3 stimuli (e.g., A , B, and C).

However:

For the 2nd run, there is no B stimuli
For the 4th run, there is no C stimuli

How would I set up the contrasts of A,B,C and AvsB, AvsC, BvsC?

I found this archive post on the forum:

https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa-jisc.exe?A2=ind1102&L=SPM&D=0&P=17009

Based on that thread, setting up the contrasts for each run:

Contrast A  =  0.2 0 0   0.2 0 0  0.2 0 0   0.2 0 0  0.2 0 0   (6 motion parameters omitted for each run)

Contrast B = 0 0.25 0    0 0 0    0 0.25 0  0 0.25 0  0 0.25 0

Contrast C = 0  0 0.25   0 0 0.25    0  0 0.25   0  0 0    0 0 0.25

contrast A-C =  1/5 0 -1/4     1/5 0 -1/4    1/5 0 -1/4     1/5 0 0        1/5 0 -1/4 

Is the above correct?

Another question is for Runs 2 and 4 with missing one stimuli, the number of cells for names onsets and durations would be one less than Runs 1,3,5 that received all 3 stimuli, A,B,and C. Wouldn't that change the number of indicies for runs 1 and 2? In the contrast setup above there are no missing indices , but just a value of 0 for the missing stimuli.  However, how would that correspond to the positioning of stimuli if the names, onsets, and durations are missing 1 value for runs 1 and 2.

Thanks.

Zurich Center for Neuroeconomics

 

Doctoral student in a project about the development of habits, its neural implementation and clinical application

 

The Zurich Center for Neuroeconomics is a research center with the Laboratory for Social and Neural Systems Research (SNS Lab) at its heart. In this interdisciplinary laboratory, researchers explore the neural mechanisms that underlie decision making and learning. The SNS Lab is in a custom-built section of the MR Centre at the University Hospital Zurich and equipped with research-dedicated facilities for MRI, EEG, behavioral measurements, brain stimulation, and pharmacological manipulations.

 

Your responsibilities

The doctoral student position will be funded by SNSF project "The process of habitization, its neural implementation and clinical application." The goal of this project is to reveal how the process of shaping habits from instrumental learning experiences works on a formal level, how it is implemented in the human brain, and how it may become pathological in substance use disorders. The successful candidate will plan, conduct, and analyze studies about the development of human habits with a focus on the learning process and how learned associations influence later decision making. For this purpose, they will acquire behavioral, EEG, and/or MRI data with healthy and/or substance use disorder patients, apply computational models of behavior, prepare scientific manuscripts about the studies and the generated insights, and present their work at national and international conferences.

 

Your profile

The candidate should hold (or expect to hold by the end of July) a very good Master's degree in one of the following (or similar) domains: Psychology, Neuroscience, Physics, or Computer Science. They should have a strong interest in the basic mechanisms of learning and decision making. The candidate should have strong skills in research methods and scientific data analysis, good programming skills (demonstrated experience with MATLAB, R, or Python), a strong proactive, collaborative, and creative working approach, as well as strong organization, social and communication skills. They should possess excellent English skills (both written and oral). German is a plus (but not essential). They should also feel comfortable interacting with study participants. Preference will be given to applicants with experience in MRI or EEG data analysis and/or in conducting behavioral, EEG, or MRI experiments. The working language in the laboratory is English and all PhD courses are taught in English.

Dear all,


Thank you for your attention. I am a PhD student working on foreign language learning in motor cotex.
As a newbie user of matlab/spm, I would like to ask two questions about slice timing and physio data.

(1) when entering the "Slice order" of "Slice Timing", I entered a vector suggested by the instruction as I am using a Simens scanner with multi-band.
However, the following instruction made me doubt if I should apply the "TR - INTRASCAN TIME - SLICE_TIME VECTOR".
Should I skip this step because my slice oder is not top to bottom or bottom to up, or I should still consider this regarding the scanner defult setting suggested by the instruction "Slice ordering is assumed to be from FEET to HEAD"?



(2) Has anyone used the "Physio TaPas (SPM toolbox)" (from https://irmf.int.univ-amu.fr/en/research-support/data-and-processing/physiological-data/) please?
I have followed the instruction but it didn't work even there was no error with the spm codes.
Then I applied the Troubleshoot to "manually copy the PhysIO Toolbox PhysIO/code folder to spm/toolbox/PhysIO", but the PhysIO package is still not shown in the SPM toolbox.
Has anyone had the same problem with the "Physio TaPas (SPM toolbox)" or is there any suggestion for adding the physio data into the spm pre-processing please?



Thank you very much for your time and help.
Please feel free to contact me via this email if there is anything unclear.



Many thanks,
Sincerely yours,

Tzuyi Tseng

Dear friends and colleagues,

I am pleased to announce my new, shiny, improved summer schools! This year in the alluring Bucharest (Romania).

*** NEW THIS YEAR *** I have developed several lectures and demos on integrating ChatGPT-4 (and AI-assistance more generally) into coding, writing, and analysis. Both summer-school courses include new discussions and coding/writing exercises aimed at effective and ethical use of ChatGPT in neuroscience research and data analysis. ***

I will teach two separate week-long courses on neuroscience data analysis: One about time-frequency/synchronization/statistics (*note: this same course is offered twice due to popular demand!*), and one about linear algebra and dimension-reduction/source-separation.

Below is the direct link to the course pages with application information. Please pass this link around to your colleagues/students who might be interested in one or both of these courses.
https://sincxpress.com/summerschool.html

Analyzing neural time series data
(26-30 June *AND* 14-18 August). Fourier transform, convolution, time-frequency analysis, synchronization, nonparametric statistics, simulating time series data. (Note: the August session is recommended for people taking both courses.)

Linear algebra for neuroscientists
(21-25 August). Matrix algebra, least-squares model fitting, eigendecomposition, multivariate source separation, simulating multicomponent and multichannel time series data.

https://sincxpress.com/summerschool.html

Please note that applications, if accepted, are selected on a first-come-first-serve basis, and that the number of participants for each course is limited to 30. The courses are currently filling up but are not yet at capacity.

I appreciate your prompt response to the second question. However, I noticed that you may have missed the first question about gray balance parameter. I am really interested in knowing the answer to that question, so I wanted to kindly remind you of it.

For your convenience, I have attached the file again to this message.

Actually, I am a freshman student, and my course teacher assigned me the task of understanding head motion correction and reproducing code that has the same functionality as spm_realign.m. To be honest, this is a difficult task for me because my math and programming foundations are still weak. However, after carefully reading and thinking about the relevant chapters in the book you mentioned, I have successfully written the code (at least it can run. As for the effect, who konws).

I would like to know if I can explain my understanding of spm head motion correction to you so that I can know if my understanding of the principles is correct. If so, I will attach my understanding (and maybe code) in the next message.

If not, please tell me directly.  I don't know anything about patents and such in the industry.

I would greatly appreciate it if you could take a moment to respond to this question at your earliest convenience. Thank you very much for your time and assistance.

Best regards,
Xinyue Jiang

There are no papers that accurately describe the motion correction method in SPM, although this book chapter will give an approximate description of what is done:
https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/doc/books/hbf2/pdfs/Ch2.pdf

If the matrix is singular, this might suggest that the overlap between images is poor or there aren't enough slices to compute everything needed.  You could use the pseudo-inverse (pinv in MATLAB ) or you could introduce a little bit of regularisation.

Normally I solve this type of problem with:

increment =  (A'*A + R)\(A'*b)

where R is a positive definite matrix that serves as a regulariser.

Best regards,
-John



Good Morning,
my lab is working on DTI analysis on depressed people. We are analyzing differences and correlations for the different DTI metrics. However, we also have rest fMRI acquisition for the majority of our subjects. My Boss asked me if it is possible to analyze the correlations, at the voxel level, between DTI (e.g. FA) and functional connectivity.
The rest fMRI was analyzed using the ICA method and the dual regression. Therefore, as outputs (from dual regression), we have the maps of the functional connectivity.
My question is: can someone tell me if it is possible to run voxel-based correlations between FA (and the other DTI metrics) and the maps from the dual regression?

Thanks,
Manu
