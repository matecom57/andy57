Thanks. Another difference is the first row of fix4melview file. I am not 
sure whether this difference is from HCP or FSL FIX. When I ran hcp_fix, 
the former FIX's fix4melview had filtered_func_data.ica at the first row, 
but the pyfix's fix4melview had fMRI_name.ica. Could you please check this 
as well?

Hi Joo-Won,

That's correct - 1.06.15 is the latest version of the original 
MATLAB-based FIX.

Hi Andraws,

The first command was:

cat /mnt/wslg/versions.txt

You need to be very precise when running commands in a terminal.

Can you also open a Powershell (as administrator), and run "wsl --update", 
and send me the output of running that command?

Paul

Hi Paul 
I wrote your codes after restating my laptop,
The outputs are in the attachment.

Hi Andraws,

Would you be able to reboot your computer and try again? Also note that 
WSL / Ubuntu is case-sensitive, so "FSL" is not the same as "fsl" (the 
latter is the correct command).

If things are still not working after a reboot, can you run all of these 
commands in a WSL terminal and send me the output:

cat /mnt/wslg/versions.txt
echo $DISPLAY
ls -la /tmp/.X11-unix
ls -la /tmp/.X11-unix/
cat /mnt/c/Users/Andrwas/.wslconfig

Hi Andraws,

Can you confirm your WSL and Windows versions, by running these commands 
in a PowerShell terminal, and sending me their output?

wsl --version
[System.Environment]::OSVersion.Version

Hi Paul, 
The FSL GUI doesn’t run after even using  :export DISPLAY=:0
All verifications steps run till this FSL & 
and show that after running your code  export DISPLAY=:0

Hi Andraws,

Does the FSL GUI open if you run this command first?

export DISPLAY=:0

If the FSL GUI opens after doing that, also try opening FSLeyes.

Hi ,
For your information,  my version of FSL is 6.0.7.13 and I use  wsl2

I don't think that I need  xserver.

Hi ,
I start again from scratch as you said and the verification process 
complete untill this error occured while writing the fsl & command  as 
showed in the attached picture .

Hi paul ,
I will do that 
But how can I remove the previously installed data for wsl and ubuntu from 
my disk? 
I cannot localize it manually and it take huge amount of my disk space!
Thank you so much for your help.

Are you using Windows 10 or Windows 11?
 
In either case I think the easiest option may be to start again from 
scratch, but making sure that you have the latest version of WSL installed 
before proceeding with the installation, and ensuring that you make a note 
of the username / password that you set up for the Ubuntu installation. 

You should be able to follow the instructions here: 
https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/docs/#/install/windows?id=install-wsl-ubuntu

Hi Andraws,
If you originally installed under a different username, then you can 
temporarily switch to that username with 

su - <username>

If FSL appears to be installed and working for that user, then there are 
instructions online to make WSL login as that user by default ( as opposed 
to root ). If you installed FSL as the “root” user then, as Paul says, you 
may just need to manually set-up the environment.

Hope this helps,
Kind Regards
Matthew

Hi Andraws,

It looks like you have installed FSL as the root (admin) user. This is 
generally only recommended when installing FSL onto a multi-user system. 
When you run the fslinstaller script as the root user, the fslinstaller 
script does not set up your shell profile, because it assumes that you are 
a system administrator on a multi-user system.

If you don't have a specific reason to do so, I would suggest setting up a 
normal (non-root) user account, and installing FSL under that account.

Otherwise, If you want to continue using your root account, you will need 
to manually add the FSL configuration commands to your shell profile - you 
should be able to to do this by following the instructions at 
https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/docs/#/install/configuration

Dear FSL Community,

I am attempting to perform a Two Groups with continuous covariate 
interaction model, which includes:
- a group explanatory variable (EV),
- a postnatal age continuous covariate,
- a scanner upgrade covariate,
- and an interaction term between the group and postnatal age covariates.

I have a total of 98 subjects (46 patients and 52 controls), and my aim is 
to test whether there is are significant group differences and interaction 
effects between the groups.
I have followed the instructions from the documentation: 
https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/docs/#/statistics/glm?id=two-groups-with-continuous-covariate-interaction.
I merged the 98 volumes into a single file (named 
BrainDNIU_ASL_all_new.nii.gz) after registering them to the same perfusion 
template. Here is my current setup:

Design Matrix
- 1st column: Demeaned postnatal age,
- 2nd and 3rd columns: Group EVs,
- 4th column: Scanner upgrade covariate,
- 5th and 6th columns: postnatal age*group Interaction effects.

PNA_demean_IUGR_vs_control_CV4Group_ScannerUpgrade_Interaction.con -m 
BrainDNIU_ASL_mean_masked_mask_new.nii.gz -n 300 -D --T2


Issue:
When I run this command, I receive the following warning: "tfce has 
detected a large number of integral steps. This operation may require a 
great deal of time to complete."

Initially, I encountered this problem while running the model with the 
design matrix structured as follows:
- 1st and 2nd columns: Group EVs,
- 3rd column: Undemeaned postnatal age,
- 4th column: Scanner upgrade,
- 5th and 6th columns: postnatal age*group Interaction effects.
I ran the same command with 500 permutations, but the warning appeared 
after the first two rounds of permutations, specifically during the 
evaluation of the postnatal age covariate.

To address this, I:
- Demeaned the postnatal age covariate,
- Rearranged the matrix so the postnatal age column is the first,
- Reduced the number of permutations from 500 to 300.
However, the warning still persists, and the analysis takes an excessive 
amount of time. Last time (with my previous design and contrast files), 
the process got stuck for two weeks, and I had to terminate it.

Could there be an issue with my design or contrast files?
I would greatly appreciate any insights or suggestions to resolve this 
issue.

Kind regards,
Seline
