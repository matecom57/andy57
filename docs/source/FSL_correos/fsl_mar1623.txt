Dear FSL experts,
will there be a registration fee for the FSL online course this autumn and if yes is the amount already decided on? Will a schedule be available?
Best, Melissa


The mind of a bee

This worked! Thank you so much!

surf2surf has some undocumented behavior that should either be eliminated or at least documented in the help. Specifically, these two function calls create different outputs:

surf2surf -i cortex_5124.surf.gii -o mygifti.gii
surf2surf -i cortex_5124.surf.gii -o mygifti.surf.gii

If the output filename does not include "surf.gii", a new property named `MyScalars` is created with all the vectors specified as having an intensity of zero. Since this vector has no variability, this bloated data has no additional information, but subsequent tools may behave in unexpected ways when handling this data. In general, I would advise against adding uninformative information to files in an interchange format.

The problem can be seen here:
  https://github.com/muschellij2/FSL6.0.0/blob/3c3dd651066ee189bc8c290f744ca48cb3d1f156/src/ptx2/csv_mesh.cc#L287
I can not imagine why anyone would ever want a dummy vector created, but if there is a use case perhaps surf2surf could have the user explicitly request this:
  surf2surf -i surf.surf.gii -o surf2.surf.gii --scalar=MyScalars

Dear reader,

What program is recommended to use for the conversion of DICOM files to NIfTI format?

yep, but it would not necessarily harm if you set up a prospective study __
however, it in of our earlier works https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0049451 it wasn't matched either...

    You don't necessarily need the data in the same voxel grid to do that.
