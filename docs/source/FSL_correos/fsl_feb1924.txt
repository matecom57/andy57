Hi Knut,

The latest version of FSL comes with dcm2niix v1.0.20230411, although a new version (v1.0.20240202) was released just a couple of days ago. If the version in your FSL installation doesn't work, then you should be able to upgrade to the latest version by running:

$FSLDIR/bin/mamba update dcm2niix

Paul


Hi Wendy,

Yes, it looks like you have run out of memory. Are you running FEAT on a cluster system? You may need to get in touch with your IT team to check that the FEAT jobs are being submitted to a machine with sufficient RAM - typically you will need two to three times the size of your image data (X*Y*Z*timepoints*4 bytes).

Paul


Hi Knut,

It looks like there has been a problem with image reconstruction / DICOM->NIFTI conversion for this image - I am able to load it into FSLeyes, but it looks like the image has been constructed such that all slices have been concatenated into one big 2D slice in the X / Y dimensions.

What tool are you using for the DICOM->NIFTI conversion? We generally recommend Chris Rorden's dcm2niix, which gets installed as part of FSL.

Paul


Hi Knut,

Can you share one of the problematic datasets with me so I can have a play? You should have received a link to a onedrive folder that you can upload the files into.

Paul


Hi Knut,

What version of FSL / FSLeyes are you using? Do FSLeyes / bet work on other images?

Paul


Hi Cain,

I can't assess the registration quality from those screenshots. Are you able to share all of the image files used in that command? You should have received a link to a onedrive folder where you can upload the files.

Paul


Hi Mira,

You will need to correct your image orientations before attempting to perform any registration. You can find some recommendations on how to do this at this page:

https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/docs/#/other/orientation?id=the-labels-in-fsleyes-are-wrong-or-missing

Paul


Dear Meredith,

I would be hesitant to use different warp resolutions because, as you say, this may introduce a bias. Imagine if the higher warp resolution (and therefore likely more accurate alignment) is more consistently selected for one group over another - we would not know whether differences in activation between those groups were real or simply an artefact of the registration.

Have you tried an intermediate warp resolution to see if that produces more consistent results across participants?

Best wishes,
Rick



Dear Community,

I'm trying to run the smoothing and high-pass filter in FSL after preprocessing through fMRIPrep. I have just tried on one participant and it shows an error. This is the error in the log:

I wonder what the issue is here. Is it an out-of-memory issue? but I just tested one participant. If it's the memory issue how could I adjust? Can anyone kindly tell me what was wrong please?

Dear FSL experts,
We have been noticing in one of our fMRI studies that different levels of nonlinear warp resolution work noticeably better for different participants. Is it acceptable to use different levels of this parameter across people in the same study in order to optimize the registration for each person or will that create bias in our analyses in some way?
Thanks,
Meredith Braskie

Dear Tutors and Community,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm seeking your expertise on a couple of challenges I've encountered in my neuroimaging analysis process.

Post-Registration Concern: After completing the registration process, I observed an unexpected artefact—a circular region appearing outside the boundaries of the standard brain model. This occurrence seems unusual, and I'm uncertain about its commonality or implications. 

Statistical Map Clusters: Similarly, in the group analysis statistical maps, I've identified several clusters located outside the brain's physical structure. I'm puzzled about whether this is a common finding or if it indicates a potential issue in the analysis pipeline.

Given these observations, I have a few questions:

Are these phenomena commonly encountered in neuroimaging analyses, and if so, what are their implications?
What troubleshooting steps would you recommend to address these issues effectively?
I've noticed that skull-stripping is not commonly applied to functional images in the pipelines I've reviewed online. Could introducing skull-stripping to functional images be a viable solution to my problem? Also, what potential 'side effects' or considerations should I know about if I choose to pursue this approach?
Your insights and guidance on these matters would be immensely valuable to me. I am eager to learn from your experiences and to apply your advice to improve my analysis.
PS: This is a task-fMRI analysis and I use ICA-aroma to remove motion artefact.

Thank you very much for your time and support.


Many thanks,
Yiling Shi (she/her)


Hi Paul



I used dcm2niix-1.0.20220720-4.fc39.x86_64 which I installed with dnf install dcm2niix. I will try to use the version that is included in FSL.

Dear FSL expert,

I have processed several DTI sequences with dcm2niix. However, when I tried to open them with FSLeyes or BET, it crashed for some of the files with a segmentation error. I am, however, able to open all files with Freeview from FreeSurfer. I have used these options when converting: dcm2niix -o "folder" -f '%f_%p_%t_%s' -z y -v 1 $dcmfolder. How can I debug this problem? It has crashed on Fedora 39 and Centos 9.

When I open with FSLeye I got this error

Hi Paul,

Thanks for your reply. Based on your suggestions, I first ran fslreorient2std for each input image, as follows:

fslreorient2std T1.nii.gz T1_reo.nii.gz
fslreorient2std T1_mask.nii.gz T1_mask_reo.nii.gz
fslreorient2std EPI.nii EPI_reo.nii

And then run the registration,

epi_reg \
--epi=EPI_reo.nii \
--t1=T1_reo.nii.gz \
--t1brain=T1_mask_reo.nii.gz \
--out=epi_reg_d
