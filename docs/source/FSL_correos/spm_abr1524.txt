The brain is a complex network that underlies our thoughts and actions. Disruption of brain network has been associated with neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease. Understanding how brain network operates in supporting cognitive functions is fundamental for improving performance, treating disorders and developing next generation of artificial intelligence. 

Recent works from Associate Professor Kai-Hsiang Chuang’s lab at the University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia, have demonstrated the potential of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in locating network hubs that are causal for memory formation. We are developing imaging, modelling and interventional techniques to define and modulate this memory network in rodent models and humans. These techniques will have potential for enhancing memory and the diagnosis and treatment of cognitive impairment and dementia.

This PhD project will develop a computational brain model based on The Virtual Brain platform to simulate memory formation and predict the effects of network modulation. The model will be validated by cell-type specific neuronal recordings, targeted neuromodulation and brain network imaging using simultaneous calcium photometry, optogenetic neuromodulation and fMRI in rodents. 

We welcome highly motivated individuals with backgrounds in biomedical/electrical engineering, computer science, biological science, medicine or relevant fields to join this challenging project. Experiences with neural modelling, neuroimaging and programming language are desirable.

Postdoctoral studies in Neuroimaging of Bodily Self (deadline April 22)

 

Brain, Body, and Self Laboratory, Department of Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet

 

 

The Brain, Body, and Self Laboratory (Group Ehrsson) uses neuroimaging and behavioral methods to study how we perceive our own bodies as unique objects distinct from the external environment (www.ehrssonlab.se). We aim to characterize the perceptual rules and brain mechanisms whereby a central representation of one's own body is constructed by integrating signals from the different sensory modalities (e.g., vision, touch, and proprioception). We also investigate how central body representation influences how we think, feel, and remember ourselves and how the external world looks to us. Our laboratory has expertise in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), psychophysics, and other behavioral approaches (including virtual reality technology and robotically controlled bodily illusion setups). We have local access to two state-of-the-art 3T MRI scanners, one 7T scanner, and one MEG scanner.

 

We are seeking a highly talented, innovative, and enthusiastic researcher who has been awarded a Ph.D. in cognitive neuroscience or a related field within the past two years. The successful candidate will work on projects focused on body representation, bodily illusions, multisensory integration, embodied cognition, or processes related to bodily self-awareness, including the sense of body ownership.

 

The ideal candidate should possess expertise in experimental psychology or cognitive neuroscience, with a preference for skills in psychophysics and computational modeling, and/or proficiency in neuroimaging methods, especially multivoxel pattern analyses, and/or experience with human electrophysiology (EEG, MEG) or brain stimulation methods (e.g., TMS). The candidate will be expected to work within the framework of our research program (www.ehrssonlab.se), yet will have considerable freedom to develop their own ideas and project proposals. The ability to work independently, initiate and lead novel research projects, and prepare high-quality draft manuscripts for research articles is crucial. Applicants must demonstrate an excellent academic track record, including high-quality publications in international peer-reviewed journals.

 

The application must me uploaded via the Karolinska job recruitment portal: http://ki.varbi.com/what:job/jobID:687736/

 

An application must contain the following documents in English or Swedish:

A complete curriculum vitae, including date of the thesis defence, title of the thesis, previous academic positions, academic title, current position, academic distinctions, and committee work
A complete list of publications
A summary of current work (no more than one page)
 

Deadline: April 22nd, 2024

Dear friends and colleagues,

I am pleased to announce two summer schools on neural data analysis, in the alluring Bucharest (Romania).

There are two separate week-long courses on neuroscience data analysis: One about time-frequency/synchronization/statistics (*note: this same course is offered twice due to popular demand*), and one about linear algebra and dimension-reduction/source-separation. Both courses include discussions and demos on ethically incorporating generative AI into coding, writing, analysis, and hypothesis-generation.

Below is the direct link to the course pages with application information. Please pass this link around to your colleagues/students who might be interested in one or both of these courses.
https://sincxpress.com/summerschool.html

Analyzing neural time series data
(29 July - 2 August *and* 12-16 August). Fourier transform, convolution, time-frequency analysis, synchronization, nonparametric statistics, simulating time series data. (Note: the second session is recommended for people taking both courses.)

Linear algebra for neuroscientists
(19-23 August). Matrix algebra, least-squares model fitting, eigendecomposition, multivariate source separation, simulating multicomponent and multichannel time series data.

https://sincxpress.com/summerschool.html

Please note that applications, if accepted, are selected on a first-come-first-serve basis, and that the number of participants for each course is limited to 30.

If you have questions about the courses, please feel free to contact me.

I look forward to welcoming you to Bucharest this summer!

Hello,

I'm currently analysing an fMRI dataset of awake and sedated participants hearing some sounds. 

We wanted to run an ROI analysis, with ROIs being (left and right) Heschl's gyrus, A2 and some subthalamic nuclei.

At first we thought of applying small volume correction at the first level, but for 3/40 awake participants we found no significant voxels in any of these ROIs individually or combined together. The error was:

"Error using spm_est_non_sphericity. Please check your data: There are no significant voxels"

Now, the fact that awake, healthy participants who were played sounds for 15 minutes do not have A1, A2 or the thalamus activated is rather strange.. We therefore thought that perhaps we should perform a whole-brain analysis at the first level and then extract the ROI activity from the contrast images of the first level by applying our masks.

Do you think this is appropriate? If anyone has any ideas or suggestions, please let us know 🙂

Thanks a lot in advance,

Benedetts

Hi Marko

It would depend on whether it is the first image after dicom to nifti conversion of if it has been resliced to some other space. In the first case the transformation matrix M=spm_get_space('yourfilename.nii'). Subsequently you can use P=spm_imatrix(M) to find out around which axis the original images were rotated (compared to an axial orientation), images which were acquired in strictly axial orientation (with respect to the scanner coordinate system) will have zeros at P(4:6) coronal images will be rotated around x, P(4), and sagittal images have been rotated around y, P(5).

Hi Marek

I have tried the GitHub developer version on an M2 chip and it works like a charm, and I see no problem why M3 should be any different. You still need to use the troubleshooting tip found here: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/SPM/Installation_on_64bit_Mac_OS_(Intel) to tel macos that the software can be trusted. For additional speedup you may want to use Apple’s implementation of BLAS, see description on Mathworks' homepage https://blogs.mathworks.com/matlab/2023/12/13/life-in-the-fast-lane-making-matlab-even-faster-on-apple-silicon-with-apple-accelerate/

”you do need to randomise the order of those event-types“

 

Regarding the event order, would it be advisable to generate a new random order for each subject, or should we create one random sequence and have all participants follow this identical order?

 

If you only care about the average over participants, then it is arguably better to control for possible order effects, ie vary orders randomly or counterbalance some feature of the order. However, if you care about individual differences between participants (eg age), then better to have a fixed order, ie minimise any other sources of between-participant variance.

 

 

”I would ask why you are using such long SOAs“

 

After each event is presented, participants are required to make a subjective rating on the stimuli by pressing a key. We think that the extended SOAs will allow brain activity induced by the key press to return to baseline levels.

 

I’m afraid this indicates that you have not understood the efficiency of fMRI designs. Under linear assumptions (and for comparisons between event-types), you do not need to extend SOAs to allow activity to return to baseline – please consult https://imaging.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/imaging/DesignEfficiency

 

 

 

Furthermore, if I wish to generate an optimal sequence, I understand that I should randomly produce several sequences, say 1000, and then use the helpful function fMRI_GLM_efficiency.m you provided to calculate the efficiency degree of each sequence. The sequence with the highest efficiency degree would be considered the optimal one, correct?

 

Yes

Actually, you do not need additional jitter to optimise fMRI efficiency with such long and varied SOAs – your HRF-convolved regressors will already be reasonably decorrelated. Jitter becomes more important when you have a short minimal SOA, and needs to be over a much larger range than 1-2 seconds to have any effect on correlation between regressors (eg 2-12 seconds)*. And even then, such jitter is only needed if you want to estimate the response versus inter-event baseline; if you only care about differences between two types of events, you do not need to jitter, but you do need to randomise the order of those event-types (in which case, the shortest SOA possible is optimal, assuming no nonlinear saturation of the HRF). So if you don’t care about contrasts versus baseline (and are happy to assume a fixed canonical HRF), then I would ask why you are using such long SOAs (unless you have a limited number of stimuli, since more TRs is nearly always more efficient)?

 

With 6 conditions (event-types) and such long SOAs (assuming they need to be long for psychological reasons), some orders of event-types can more optimal than others, to avoid too much signal (for your contrasts of interest) being lost in the low-frequency fMRI noise (eg if you highpass filter). That optimal order depends on which contrasts (effects) in your 2x3 design are most important – you want such contrasts to have the highest frequency (ie vary fastest).

 

This webpage is probably easiest to start with for a conceptual overview: https://imaging.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/imaging/DesignEfficiency, then if you want to simulate efficiencies of different designs, try this function: https://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/www/sites/3/2013/09/fMRI_GLM_efficiency.m, which accompanies this more technical paper: https://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/www/sites/3/2015/03/Henson_EN_15_Efficiency.pdf.  

 

Hope this helps

Rik

 

* If you have a long TR>2s, and your SOAs are multiples of your TR, you could jitter by 0-TR/2 secs to ensure a higher effective sampling rate, but that is a different reason – see above webpage.

Subject: Re: [SPM] How to determine the optimal stimulus sequence for a slow-event fMRI experiment?

 

Luna,

 

I do not understand entirely your question.

 

In principle, you build your experiment as you normally would do for a behavioral psychological experiment, with the addition of jittering (a random addition between say 1-2 seconds) in the inter trial/stimulus intervals for better estimation of the BOLD function.

 

In SPM, you determine for each condition a regressor with as onset times of the stimulus onsets in each condition, and the duration of the stimulus (which you can interpret as a single peak, hence duration = 0; or for the whole length of the stimulus, hence duration = 2 s)

 

I hope this answers your question,

 

Frank

Hi all,

 

In my experiment, there are six conditions belong to two independent variables (2x3).

 

We are interested into the interaction effect of 2x3 ANOVA on activation (beta values) of six conditions.

 

A slow event design will be used: each event lasting two seconds, with intervals between events ranging from 8 to 14 seconds. Each session comprises 32 events.

 

Are there any tools or MATLAB codes available to help determine the best stimulus sequence for this slow event design?

 

Thank you!

Dear Professor Henson,


Thank you very much for your detailed response. So additional jitter is not required for the long and varied Stimulus Onset Asynchronies (SOAs) we’re using.

”you do need to randomise the order of those event-types“

Regarding the event order, would it be advisable to generate a new random order for each subject, or should we create one random sequence and have all participants follow this identical order?

”I would ask why you are using such long SOAs“

After each event is presented, participants are required to make a subjective rating on the stimuli by pressing a key. We think that the extended SOAs will allow brain activity induced by the key press to return to baseline levels. Additionally, we aim to observe the trend of signal change over time under each experimental condition; thus, the longer SOAs should enhance the visibility of these signal changes.

Furthermore, if I wish to generate an optimal sequence, I understand that I should randomly produce several sequences, say 1000, and then use the helpful function fMRI_GLM_efficiency.m you provided to calculate the efficiency degree of each sequence.

Dear Peter,
thank you for your reply. We implemented a PEB-of-PEBs approach as suggested. However, we seem to be encountering an issue. I'll briefly outline our design to provide context:
Our study involved a group of subjects who participated in an fMRI experiment consisting of 2 sessions. During session 1 they didn't take LSD and undertook a rest run and a run in which they only listened to music. In session 2 they took LSD and they undertook a rest run and a music run.

For the DCM analysis, we included 8 regions and we modelled A-matrix since no task was performed in either the music or in rest runs.
Subsequently, we conducted 2 separeted PEB analyses: one for the rest condition and one for the music condition.  In both analyses, we included a covariate representing the LSD condition (coded as 1 for LSD and -1 for no LSD).
Following your suggestion, we attempted a third-level PEB analysis using the command:

PEBofPEBs = spm_dcm_peb(PEBs, X3)

where PEBs is a vertical cell array containing musicPEB and restPEB and X3 is a column with 1 -1.
However, upon running the code, we encountered an error regarding the absence of the "pC" parameter. The error message reads:

Error in spm_find_pC (line 52)
if isstruct(pC)

Error in spm_dcm_peb (line 149)
   q = spm_find_pC(DCM,field);

We also attempted to conduct subject-specific PEB analyses first, using the following code:
PEB_subject1 = spm_dcm_peb([‘GCM_subject1_session1.mat’; ‘GCM_subject1_session2.mat’],X2)

However, we encountered the same issue when attempting the third-level PEB analysis.
What am I missing? Could you please advise on what might be causing this problem?

Thank you.
Best,

Maria Giulia

Dear SPM Experts,

I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out for assistance with setting up flexible factorial designs.

I am currently working on a task design which involves listening to auditory stimuli. The participants were required to categorize the sounds into pleasant (P), neutral (N), and unpleasant (U).

For the first-level analysis, I computed three contrasts per subject: U>N, P>N, and U+P>N. These contrasts were chosen to model the effect of affective sounds compared to neutral ones.

Now, I am looking to investigate how brain activity in response to affective sounds varies across different groups (4 levels). I intend to employ a flexible factorial model, incorporating subjects as random effects and groups as a fixed effect.

I have a few questions regarding this:

Are the three first-level contrasts I computed sufficient for second-level analysis? Or do I need to compute contrasts representing the effects of pleasant alone (1 0 0), neutral alone (0 1 0), and unpleasant alone (0 0 1) to be used in the second level?

My primary interest lies in examining the main effect of group and the interaction effect of group (4 levels) * condition (3 levels: P, U, N). Which first level contrasts should be included in the factor condition? I am concerned because if I input contrasts like U>N and P>N, neutral is represented twice. Is this a problem?

Could you please direct me to any resources that guide through the implementation of flexible factorial ANOVA in SPM, including setting up contrasts and the subject factor?

Thank you very much for your time and assistance.
I look forward to your guidance.

Best,

Hello

I am trying to build a GLM that contains several regressors of interest, some of which may lack in certain sessions (= runs), depending on the participant’s answers (for example when a participant doesn’t chose a given audibility rating during a whole session).

This causes my timing files to contain empty vectors in the ‘durations’ and ‘onsets’ cell arrays for the given regressor, and sum returns an error.

I saw on a forum that one can put an onset that is larger than the scan length, eg 1000s; I tried this band it seems fine to me (here is an example design matrix for a given run; I entered 1000secs onsets / 0s durations for the regressors shown in the 7th and 13th columns, which appear empty in the matrix).

Can you confirm it is correct?

Thank you for your help,
Best

Zeros in the background - Try either

(i1(i2>0))./(i2(i2>0))

Where i1=T1, i2=t2

That could be a bit messy depending on distribution of values in t2 (i.e. you may still get some v.big values) so imho probably better to make a mask (i3) using gm, wm (+/- csf) segmentations and doing same trick but using i3>0 instead of i2.

Dear SPM Experts,

I am reaching out to seek your guidance on a matter pertaining to my fMRI experiment.

I want to analyse data with the following structure:


  Event related design, within subject, 40 subjects
  two blocks with 15 min. duration, no break in between
  21 events A in block 1 (pseudrandomly distributed within the block)
  21 events B in block 2 (pseudrandomly distributed within the block)
  duration of all events between 0.2-4 seconds (dependent on participant response time)
I want to contrast condition A and B in the context of a general linear model.

My questions are the following:

 I am aware that scanner drift rate can make problems in this setup. What effect would I observe in my results? Can I estimate how strong the effects of scanner drift rate on my results are?
Due to the somewhat block-like nature: How problematic would a high-pass filter as part of my analysis be? I currently have a filter with a cutoff of 4320 seconds.
How much trust would you put in any results of this analysis?
Is there a different analysis approach that would lead to more trustworthy results.
Thank you in advance and warm regards,

Negin Javaheri

Hello all,

I have a question regarding the exact workings of SPM12's first level analysis.

For our experiment, we record four blocks of our participants performing a task with 8 different conditions. I then perform a first level analysis on the single participant level, contrasting these 8 conditions. I then continue my analysis outside of SPM12, using the beta weights from this first level analysis.

What I have noticed is that, when I perform this procedure, not every voxel is assigned a beta weight, and the amount of voxels with beta weights vary between participant. Crucially, when I overlay the beta weights onto a standardised brain, mostly the outermost voxels within the brain are not always assigned beta weights. This is inconvenient as it involves voxels that are within my pre-established ROI.

I have examined my preprocessing pipeline and this appears to have been done correctly (specifically the normalisation and setting of the origin). Is it to be expected that not all voxels within the normalised brains are assigned a beta weight by the first level analysis? Is there a solution to this?

Any insights would be highly appreciated.

Best regards,

Jules Erkens

Dear Ling

It seems that either the parameters or their estimated variance are complex numbers, rather than real numbers, which is a bit weird. I expect your results are fine, because you’ve got non-trivial explained variance for all subjects, but I’d like to check… What kind of DCMs are these? Feel free to send me one subject’s DCM (zipped) so I can reproduce the issue.

Hello all,

 

After performing DCM inversion for all subjects, I reviewed the results using spm_dcm_fmri_check and encountered numerous warning messages:

Warning: Imaginary parts of complex X and/or Y arguments ignored

> In spm_plot_ci (line 179)

The line 179 in spm_plot_ci is:

 Variable ‘c’ contains complex numbers.

 

 Additionally, I noticed that the majority of values in DCM.Ep.A are less than 0.01.

However, the variance explained values outputted by spm_dcm_fmri_check are not low (bigger than 25% for all subjects).

Does this suggest a failure in estimation or no connectivity at all among regions?

Thanks a lot!

 

I wish you good.

Dear Shuaicheng Liu
To contrast the conditions, you would ideally have modulatory inputs that correspond to the difference between conditions within each DCM. E.g. you would have a modulator for [condition 1 - condition 2], rather than separate modulators for condition 1 and condition 2. Is that possible in this case? Feel free to share more about the experimental design if you'd like guidance on how to implement that.

Alternatively, you can compare parameters from the PEB model using a function called spm_dcm_peb_con.m . But that's not ideal - better to have the differences between conditions explicitly included in the DCM.

Dear Michael and list,

we have recently published a paper that compares regulations in several jurisdictions and provide some practical hints for data sharing for people in the EU.

Reer, A., Wiebe, A., Wang, X., & Rieger, J. W. (2023). FAIR human neuroscientific data sharing to advance AI driven research and applications: Legal frameworks and missing metadata standards. Frontiers in Genetics, 14, 1086802.

The short version is:

Note that the GDPR does no apply to anonymous data. Therefore destroy the coding list as soon as possible. In case you have identifiable information like images that include external features such as faces remove the external features (see e.g. re-facing tools if you are worried about data quality). For eye tracking share the tracking data but not the videos etc. Add some noise to metadata that potentially provide personal  information that make identification easier (e.g. age etc).

The GDPR has a risk based approach to re-identification. Meaning not all possible re-identification approaches are relevant for the assessment of re-identification. In the EEG-data request internal anatomical brain patterns do not play a role. And if even when T1 scans are shared it remains questionable if the internal features (like gyral patterns) really play a role for the risk assessment.

More important: You should get your sharing plan and the informed consent you want to get from your participants through your IRB or institutional legal assessment before you acquire the data. This is where (unfortunately) assessments can differ between boards. However, you'll never know before trying.

As it was noted previously: Informed consent is key. You need to inform your participants about what type of data you are going to share and with whom. If the data go outside the EU jurisdiction you need to get their consent. As soon as you pseudonymize data correctly the participants will loose their right for data correction/deletion. You need to get their consent for that step. 

If you want to add an additional control layer get a data usage agreement (DUA) that excludes unwanted uses from your collaboration partners.

The great thing is that you don't have to develop all these forms from scratch. The open science community already developed very useful drafts that can be found here: https://open-brain-consent.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ 

If that all does not work for you, you may consider providing your collaborators access to your local servers to do the computations there.

Best regards,

   Jochem

In cases where a key (in the widest sense) exist between data with personal information, and the public version of these data, they can, under GDPR, only be considered pseudonomised. And thus can only be shared via a data processor agreement. Part of such an agreement is an obligation to perform audits of the data processors whom you have given acces to the data, this would be outside my budget both time- and money-wise. In addition, under GDPR, the subject has the right for his/her data to be withdrawn/erased. This is quite challenging to ensure if data are spread across the world. So I am, unfortunately, not sure that consent saves the day, although it would be nice.

Anonymisation is, as pointed out tricky. An important point is, that it is only at the time of anonymisation that a key between shared data and personal data should not exist. Hence we only need to take into account already available data, not brain scans from the future. But what do we do with the consent form, depending on the number of subjects in a study this could itself become a key.

Does everybody’s legal departments in UK and EU think that datasharing is easy, in DK it is not the case?

I think it’s all about consent. My understanding of GDPR is that, if participants consent to sharing their data, then even personal data can be shared (and as long as the risks are explained to participants when they consent). Removing as much identifiable information from the data before sharing will reduce the risk and hence increase the likelihood that participants will consent. However, it is very hard to truly anonymise imaging data (e.g, defacing a T1 is not sufficient, since their brain shape is still unique to them).

Subject: [SPM] Anonymous EEG data for GDPR purposes

Dear SPMers,
 
I would like to share EEG data with US colleagues as 'anonymous data' for GDPR purposes.
Of course a data set which is rich enough will always have some risk of re-identification, either through malicious breaking into UCL computing resources, or – at least in theory – advanced data analyses against non-anonymized datasets, etc. However it is very well known that risk elimination in any sector is not a viable policy - appropriate risk management is.
 
What is the minimum 'anonymization process' for EEG data to be treated as anonymous for GDPR purposes?
 
Sincerely,
Michael

Apologies but we had to remove that FTP site. The data are however still available on OpenNeuro: https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds000117 though now in BIDS format, so you might have to do some wrangling to match up filenames.

Subject: [SPM] SPM12 example dataset

Dear SPM users,
I want to download an example dataset related to the SPM manual and got the following link that was found in the manual chapter 43.1 but I can't open the link below, is there still such a link to download the data?

Thank you,

Dear all,

I am performing a DCM on an fMRI experiment, but I have a problem with the timeseries extraction. The idea is to identify a subject-specific peak in a sphere of 9mm radius, and then extract from a 5mm-radius sphere centered on the peak. The script runs, but I receive the warning "No voxel survived. Default to user-specified centre". Having not set a threshold (matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.voi.roi{1}.spm.thresh=1), I do not understand why this is occurring. How can I fix the problem?
Attached are the script and the warning displayed in the MATLAB command window.

Here is the warning:
Warning: No voxel survived. Default to user-specified centre.

Dear Michael

I agree that you should talk to the legal office of the institution.
Here some general remarks:
- under GDPR, anonymization is effective only if everyone deletes the key linking the research data to the subjects, so this would be pseudonymization
- every country has its own declination of GDPR, there was a website detailing this but could not find it, but guess it's easy to find the one for UK
- moreover, any institution has their own rules, which might overcome other conditions
- usually data sharing under GDPR implies that the subjects have signed an agreement for their data to be shared upon a research agreement, and that a research agreement is drawn between the institutions (so again this is a matter from the legal offices of both institutions).

Hi Robert,

Thanks for this. It looks as if you are writing from the US, where I understand that the definition of 'anonymizing' is institution dependent. However I asked about GDPR (the 'General Data Protection Regulations'), because my institution asks in various forms whether my data is anonymous as per GDPR. GDPR is an international legal framework also binding in the UK (despite Brexit).

So any GDPR specific info from our colleagues would be very useful.

Subject: [SPM] Anonymous EEG data for GDPR purposes

Dear SPMers,

 

I would like to share EEG data with US colleagues as 'anonymous data' for GDPR purposes.

Of course a data set which is rich enough will always have some risk of re-identification, either through malicious breaking into UCL computing resources, or – at least in theory – advanced data analyses against non-anonymized datasets, etc. However it is very well known that risk elimination in any sector is not a viable policy - appropriate risk management is.

 

What is the minimum 'anonymization process' for EEG data to be treated as anonymous for GDPR purposes?

 

Sincerely,

Dear Experts,

We have approximately 1000 images at 2 time points and have pre-processed them in CAT12 "Segment longitudinal". Because of the large number of images, we would like to do a longitudinal analysis using difference images.
In this case, I am not sure what the appropriate threshold value is when I try to use implicit masking.
Is it better to use explicit masking?

Any suggestion would be highly appreciated.


Thank you so much,
Naoki Hirabayashi

Esteemed SPM Community,

I am encountering an issue with masking in my fMRI analysis and would greatly appreciate some assistance or insights. I am using the SPM12 toolbox in my fMRI analyses, and while reviewing the results of the 1st level analysis, I have noticed issues indicating a masking error. Previously, we were using the 3T Siemens Magnetom Trio MRI scanner, and we have been conducting our analyses using the raw data obtained from this scanner. Now, we have transitioned to a new laboratory and are using the 3T Siemens Magnetom Prisma MRI scanner. However, the raw data we obtain from this scanner is in multi-frame DICOM format, and even though SPM gives a warning during the conversion to the Nifti format, it still proceeds with the conversion. Subsequently, when we continue to use the preprocessing and individual analysis batches we used before, upon examining the results of the individual analysis, we see activations extending beyond the brain in some of the contrasts we have created. Could the issue stem from the conversion of multi-frame DICOM files to NIfTI? Are there specific parameters within SPM for masking multi-frame DICOM files that should be adjusted? Any insights on potential sources of this masking error would be greatly appreciated.

Any guidance, suggestions, or similar experiences from the community would be incredibly helpful.

Thank you in advance for your time and assistance.

Best regards,
