Hello!

I am setting up a CLI-based SOP to perform QC with FSLeyes, and I would like to display two "default" scenes (with options -xh -yh). Is it possible to do it via the CLI?  I've tried doubling the argument pair: `--scene default --scene default` (only one default scene appears) or doubling the argument value: `--scene default default` (crashes).

I know I can save a custom scene, but it is saved under `~/.fsleyes`, hence not "easily" portable to a public-facing SOP.

Many thanks!
Julien

Dear FSl community,
Happy 2023, wishing you and your loved ones a prosperous new year.
I would appreciate your input regarding a voxel wise analysis that I am working on.
I have one group of FA maps. I need to correlate clinical behaviour scale with FA within every voxel in the brain before and after adjustemnt for age.

I ran Glm gui in terminal, I chosse #of groups =1 and # of EVs =2 ... GLM window looks as follows:

Group      EV1   EV2 EV3

Input 1     1     
Input 2     1
Input 3     1
Input 4     1
.
.
.
.
etc

EV2 and EV3 are demeaned clinical scale and age. The contrast that I am interested in is negative correlation between clinical scale and FA before and after adjusting for age. Is this contrast correct?

Title               EV1     EV2   EV3
Slope (-)        0         -1      -1            (before removing age effect)
Slope (-)        0         -1      1            (after removing age effect)

EV2 is the demeaned clinical scale. EV3 is demeaned age and EV1 is for FA maps.

Thanks for any guidance.

Best.
James

Hi everyone,
I have a problem with installing fsl.
I would install it from WSL, I followed instructions on the fsl page, all passages are completed but during the processing of the command "python /mnt/c/Users/<WindowsUserName>/Downloads/fslinstaller.py" , the blue screen appears with a system error every time.
Does my pc (Dell Latitude 7490) not support fsl requirements?
Thank you in advance

Hi Matt,
It might be worth checking with the cluster tool ( if you haven’t already ) that these really are isolated 1-2 voxel clusters and not connected in a way that is hard to visualise with an orthographic viewer like FSLeyes.TFCE _can_ determine a single voxel to be significant, but it’s t-value would need to be quite high - as TFCE scores are driven by both spatial-extent and statistic magnitude. You could apply an additional threshold to your final results of a minimum cluster size ( cluster can do this with the --minextent option ) but this would need to be chosen a priori - similar to ROI analyses etc.

Kind Regards
Matthew

Hi Erin,

 

Sorry for the long delay in replying, I took some time off before Christmas for a holiday and have just returned to the lab.

 

Thank you for checking those couple of things. I’m sure we can make some tweaks to the fitting code to improve this. Would you be able to send us an example of your data and basis set so we can test against it making any changes?

 

BW

Subject: [FSL] FSL-MRS: Limit First Order Phase?

Dear Will and Saad,

Happy New Year!

We are continuing to find that FSL-MRS is imparting a significant first order phase when fitting our data (>20 deg/ppm).

In response to your previous questions:

1. There is not a first order phase on the basis set. This is a basis set for semi-LASER that was simulated with FID-A and converted with the makebasis function in LCModel, all with pretty well default settings. Attached is the output of basis_tools vis.

2. Yes, we have removed the first point in the FID, though it doesn't change the appearance of the real part of the spectrum very much. I suspect that the deviation of the first point from a pure FID is related to some residual water that is out of phase, not to errors in the timing of the pulse sequence that would lead to a first order phase effect.

It would be great if we could place a limit on how much first order phase could be allowed on the basis set.

Please let me know if you need any further info.

Thank you so much for your help,
Erin

Hi,
I'm attempting to run fsl but I'm facing an issue that relates to the fslinstaller.py that I downloaded from the website every time I want to run it in my terminal I encounter with manifest Jason error (I'm using the latest version of python).
can you help me with my issue or do you have any other version of fsl installer to send me for the latest version of macOS?

Dear FSL community,

I am trying to build a higher level FEAT analysis for the following experiment: Each subject was scanned four times on two different days. During all scans, there was a simultaneous stimulation of two sensory modalities (visual and tactile in a block design). The two scans on one day differed only with regards to the subject’s attentional focus (i.e. the subject was instructed to attend to the visual stimulus versus to tactile stimulus).
This was exactly the same on the second scan day. The only difference on day 2 was the stimulation location on the body for the tactile stimulation (location 1 versus location 2).

Ideally, I would like to set up a 2x2 repeated measures ANOVA with focus on modality (levels: visual and tactile) and stimulation location (levels: location 1 versus 2). Both of these factors would be within-subject factors. Is it possible to set this up in FEAT? I read that the GLM is not necessarily designed to handle repeated measures so I am not sure how to set up the design matrix.

So far, I have only managed to design a paired t-test. With the paired t-test I could analyse the two sensory modalities in two distinct analysis pathways to compare the effect for stimulus location in both sensory systems. However, this would mean that I cannot look at the interaction of my two factors.  

I would appreciate any tips!

All the best,
Henrike

Hi Eleanor,
                  Everything looks like it should match ( timepoints in data/matrix ), can you tar and upload your input files ( data, mask, design.mat, design.con ) to

https://oxfile.ox.ac.uk/oxfile/work/extBox?id=700839B35190E48BF

so I can check the data locally?

For the second randomise call:

randomise -i all_FA_skeletonised -o tbss -m mean_FA_skeleton_mask -d design.mat -t design.con -f —T2

The command is failing as -f needs an argument ( f-contrasts file ) and so is interpreting —-T2 as a file name ).

Kind Regards
Matthew

Dear Sally,
It looks like the global mean is not accounted for in your design, this can be done by adding the -D flag to the randomise call or by adding an extra EV that is a column of ones. I recommend the second approach as it explicitly indicates in the design how the mean has been modelled.

Hope this helps,
Kind Regards
Matthew

Dear Matthew,
 
Thank you very much for getting back to me. The randomise command I have used is:
 
randomise -i all_FA_skeletonised -o SRPTotal -m mean_FA_skeleton_mask -d SRPTotal.mat -t SRPTotal.con --T2
 
(Substituted with all_L1_skeletonised / all_RD_skeletonised depending on the metric)
 
I have attached screenshots of the design.mat and design.con files. Please let me know if I can provide any further information. 
 
Many thanks,
Sally

Hi Sally,
Can you confirm the randomise call used, as well as the contents of the design.mat/con files?

Kind Regards

Hi FSL experts,

I have performed TBSS on data from adults in the community. I am looking for associations between brain structure and scores on a self-report measure of a personality trait (I am performing linear regression analysis as opposed to looking at differences between two groups). In my GLM, all participants are labelled as being in group 1 and I have two contrasts set up to look for positive and negative correlations (age and sex included as covariates of no interest).

I have followed the FSL manual as much as possible. After running TOPUP and EDDY, I have used the TBSS (1-4) commands, built GLMs and performed randomise. I have also run the TBSS_non_FA on the Axial diffusivity (L1) images and also used FSLmaths to create Radial diffusivity images ((L2+L3)/2) and run TBSS_non_FA on the RD images and performed randomise on these metrics too. I have used TBSS_FILL and viewed the tfce corrected-p tstat images in FSLeyes and then used the cluster command to try and extract information about the significant clusters.

The issue that I have is that when I use the cluster command, the results table is identical regardless of the metric. So, the results output for FA, AD, RD are all practically identical. The coordinates that should give the ‘maximum intensity’ voxel locate this voxel in the brain stem, but the images show results are located in the corpus callosum, and the size of the cluster, according to the results output, is also quite big (around 136500 voxels) which seems much bigger than just one significant cluster.

Any help would be appreciated.
Many thanks,
Sally

I am using FSL 6.0.1

My cluster command is:

cluster -i (file_name)_tfce_corrp_tstat1.nii.gz -t 0.95 -o (file_name)_cluster_index > (file_name)_cluster_info --mm

The results output is:
Cluster Index     Voxels      MAX   MAX X (mm)  MAX Y (mm)  MAX Z (mm)  COG X (mm)  COG Y (mm)  COG Z (mm)
1     135490      1     4     -38   -51   1.16  -21.7 8.95

Dear Diego,
                        Does this command return any error messages?

${FSLDIR}/bin/standard_space_roi /Volumes/DCF_1tb/Processamento/Projects/Connectome_article2/p003/t1 /Volumes/DCF_1tb/Processamento/Projects/Connectome_article2/p003/t1_brain test_output -b -d

( you can delete the test_output_<foo> images if it runs correctly )

Kind Regards

Dear Matthew,

The FSL was installed correctly. After the upgrade, I have run the standard bet and it was ok.

Yes, there are fifteen "tmp" files!
