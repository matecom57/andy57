Hi Erin and Alex,

 

I got a pretty satisfactory fit with low first-order phase (3 deg/ppm) running what I think is a fairly default set of processing steps.

I ran the following for pre-processing:

fsl_mrs_preproc –data metabolite_data.nii.gz –reference water_data.nii.gz –output processed –hlsvd –overwrite –report –align_limits 0 3.5

There are two things to note. 1) I used the alignment limits as there is a small spurious echo in the data at around 4 ppm. 2) I didn’t remove any FID points. However I note that the first FID point appears to have a significantly smaller value than the others. I think this must arise from deliberate processing (maybe online on the scanner) or treatment in hardware. What route was this data generated from?

 

For fitting I then ran:

fsl_mrs --data processed/metab.nii.gz --basis TRISP_pad_basis/ --output wtc_fit --overwrite --metab_groups MM09 MM12 MM14 MM16 MM21 MM30 MM39 --report

I didn’t try it but I might suggest trimming the list of some very small metabolites. As ever I would certainly suggest investigating empirically generated MM rather than simulated.

 

Report hopefully attached.

Hi Will,

Great to hear that you took some time off for a holiday!

 

I will email you a link to a OneDrive folder with some sample data and our basis set.

Thank you so much for all your help, we really appreciate your support and your work to build FSL-MRS.

 

Best,

Erin

Hi Erin,

 

Sorry for the long delay in replying, I took some time off before Christmas for a holiday and have just returned to the lab.

 

Thank you for checking those couple of things. I’m sure we can make some tweaks to the fitting code to improve this. Would you be able to send us an example of your data and basis set so we can test against it making any changes?

 

BW

Dear Will and Saad,

Happy New Year!

We are continuing to find that FSL-MRS is imparting a significant first order phase when fitting our data (>20 deg/ppm).

In response to your previous questions:

1. There is not a first order phase on the basis set. This is a basis set for semi-LASER that was simulated with FID-A and converted with the makebasis function in LCModel, all with pretty well default settings. Attached is the output of basis_tools vis.

2. Yes, we have removed the first point in the FID, though it doesn't change the appearance of the real part of the spectrum very much. I suspect that the deviation of the first point from a pure FID is related to some residual water that is out of phase, not to errors in the timing of the pulse sequence that would lead to a first order phase effect.

It would be great if we could place a limit on how much first order phase could be allowed on the basis set.

Please let me know if you need any further info.

Thank you so much for your help,
Erin

Hi Jo,
This may be due to something like a path containing a space, or other whitespace character, or maybe a field was inadvertently left blank in the GUI?

Dear FSL Developers,

I'm trying to build an environment for FSL 6.0.5.2, but it fails no matter how many times I try.
I think I was successful last month. It always fails at Stage2.
I'm not sure if it's a network issue. If you have time, could you take a look at the fslpython_miniconda_installer.log?
ttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z6uGciKkPS6EuNzWrQ9fXE-gyuo6SuSi

After decompressing the FSL6.0.5.2 compressed file, I run the following installation command.
$>fsl/etc/fslconf/fslpython_install.sh -f fsl

Best regards
ryo

Dear Michele,

it is very hard to say anything specific without seeing the data. What do you see if you look at the first volume in 'outfname'.eddy_cnr_maps? My prediction is that you will have one, or a few, voxels with very extreme values. And that they completely dominate your mean across voxels (and hence also standard deviation).
You may not see that initially, depending on what visualisation software you use and how it sets the display range. You may need to set the range manually to see them. Another option is to use fslstats with the -t and -R options.
With only two b0 images it is not surprising that you would see something like this. "You" calculate a standard deviation from only two values, and you do that for all voxels. So there is a fair chance one of these will be _very_ close to zero, which you then divide the mean by.

    Hi FSL experts,
    I have come across a scan for which eddy gives very high mean and stdev SNR values. I have inspected the DTI image (which has 2 b0 volumes) manually and it visually looks ok to me (most values in the b0 volumes are between ~100 and ~1500 with a max of ~2500), without much noise outside the brain. Unfortunately, I cannot share the original data as it is confidential, but this is the extract from "qc.json" with the high values.

Hello Melissa,
                        Without seeing the full script_name.sh, so assuming the fslmaths command is the one seg-faulting, it might be worth checking that the files with background 1 don’t contain any NaNs or other problematic values, e.g.

fslmaths ./FW_f.nii.gz -nanm tempmask
fslstats tempmask -V

If the fslstats call reports a non-zero number of voxels then this is the issue.

If everything looks good, then if you tar up the input files ( mask.nii.gz and FW_f.nii.gz ) and upload to:

https://oxfile.ox.ac.uk/oxfile/work/extBox?id=700839B35190E48BF

I’ll be able to check the data locally.

Kind Regards

Hi Julien,

Unfortunately the FSLeyes command-line interface can only be used to set up a single scene at the moment. However, you could set up an arbitrary scene using the FSLeyes API via a custom Python script (which you can run with "fsleyes -r <script.py>"), for example:

std = Image(op.expandvars('$FSLDIR/data/standard/MNI152_T1_2mm'))
overlayList.append(std)

ortho    = frame.addViewPanel(OrthoPanel)
lightbox = frame.addViewPanel(LightBoxPanel)

ortho   .defaultLayout()
lightbox.defaultLayout()

Hello!

I am setting up a CLI-based SOP to perform QC with FSLeyes, and I would like to display two "default" scenes (with options -xh -yh). Is it possible to do it via the CLI?  I've tried doubling the argument pair: `--scene default --scene default` (only one default scene appears) or doubling the argument value: `--scene default default` (crashes).

I know I can save a custom scene, but it is saved under `~/.fsleyes`, hence not "easily" portable to a public-facing SOP.

Many thanks!

Hello,

I would like to confirm what the "E" and "H" values are for the default -T option in PALM.

I am conducting a functional connectivity analysis using PALM with the -T option selected for threshold free cluster enhancement (TFCE). I found in the FSL Randomise User Guide that it is recommended to use the default -T setting for the related "E", "H", and neighborhood-connectivity parameters which have already been optimized.

I also see in the FSL Threshold Free Cluster Enhancement (FMRIB Technical Report TR08SS1) paper, that it was empirically determined that parameter values of H=2, E=0.5 appear to be optimal, allowing for the avoidance of hand-tuning of the parameters.

I just want to confirm that H=2 and E=0.5 are the default setting values for the -T (TFCE) option in PALM/Randomize?

Thank you,
