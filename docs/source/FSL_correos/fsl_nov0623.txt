Hi Matthew,

This is not a repeated design. EVs 14-18 are used to correct for the different sites in the study.

Hello，

There always is a long waiting time （10 hours this time）even it finished installation, when I  am trying to install FSL on my Windows 11 WSL2 system with the FSL version 6.0.7.4 (Ubuntu 22). 

Thanks,

Hi Chloe,

How long have you waited for the installation to complete? Are you able to share the fslinstaller output and the log file?

Dear Paul,



You are right! I somehow assumed -and obviously I was wrong- that fslreorient2std was writing over the input file, therefore never worked.

Excuse me for this naive mistake and thank you once again for your help and time.



Best regards,
Georgios

Hi Georgio,

I was able to get good results by running fslreorient2std before any of your other commands. I also noticed that, in your robustfov call, you are assuming that the third voxel dimension is inferior-superior, which is not the case for your image (but would be if you were to run fslreorient2std beforehand).

Dear Paul,
Thank you for your very fast response and excuse me for late reply. I was making further tests, including fslreorient2std as you recommended. Images have the same voxel orientation and fslreorient2std did not change the results. I figured out though, that the problem does not starts from flirt but from
standard_space_roi T1_tmp_brain_reor.nii.gz T1_tmp2 -maskNONE -ssref $FSLDIR/data/standard/MNI152_T1_1mm_brain -altinput T1_orig_ud -d

which is creating an affine used later in flirt command.

The attached figure shows all involved volumes and the output of this command.

Any idea of why is this happening?

Best regards,
Georgios

Hi,

I was trying to read the source code for the newest version of eddy. And I was wondering how you managed to do the motion correction. Is there a specific function or chunk of code responsible for the motion correction?

I issued several test runs. The command I used is as follows: ./eddy_cpu --imain=…/test_data/test05_sbmot.nii.gz --mask=…/test_data/test05_sbmot_mask.nii.gz --acqp=…/test_data/acqparams.txt --index=…/test_data/index.txt --bvecs=…/test_data/test05_sbmot.bvec --bvals=…/test_data/test05_sbmot.bval --out=…/test_data/test05_sbmot_eddy.nii.gz

And I printed out the parameters and found out the place where we changed the parameters are at the volume to volume section and entered the following if statement. I was wondering if you could give me some hint on how you conduct the motion correction in the code. Like I could find where you estimate the difference, but what is the specific function/class the code uses to handle and correct the parameter and update the data stored in sm class? What’s your high-level workflow when doing the motion correction?

Thanks for your help!

Charlotte.

Hi,

 

It seems like the file is corrupt. Can you try opening the file with FSLeyes (or using nibabel in a python interpreter).

Hi all,

 

I was trying to run one of my participants through the first-level and I ran into a strange error early on in the initialization process. This participant's inputs are really no different than any of the other participants' and I double-checked that the stats were all input correctly. I haven't unzipped the nii file and just input fmriprep's AROMA output file as usual for the 4D image. What's especially strange is this subject's data for the other condition ran through the first level perfectly fine. Has anyone encountered this before? I'm not sure what could be going wrong because the I haven't really done anything initial to my nii image.

Hello FSL’ers,



I hope this email finds you well.  I am seeking your guidance regarding the exclusion criterion for fsl Motion Outliers to exclude high motion runs. 



I tested my database to exclude runs in which 25% of volumes exceed a 0.5 mm threshold of framewise displacement. However, almost 20% of the runs ( involving 40% of the participants) are excluded by this criterion. Could you please help me by recommending an exclusion criterion which is acceptable in this field that would allow me to retain as many participants as possible? 



Sincerely, 



Ming

Hi everyone!

I'm a beginner with both FSL and Python, working on diffusion images of monkey brains. I'm trying to code in Python a pipeline for processing my images with FSL commands. Everything seems to work fine until I get to the registration. I can generate the transformation matrices, but when I apply, for example, my diff2str matrix on my diffusion image, the result is not aligned with the structural image.
I thought it was coming from my code, so I tried with the GUI, and I got exactly the same thing.
Thinking it might be coming from the images, I generated and applied transformation matrices with MATLAB/spm, and everything's working properly.
So I don't understand what I need to do differently with FSL... Do you have any hypotheses?



As for the parameters used: diff2str: 6 DOF, mutual information, normal search str2std: 12 DOF, correlation ratio, normal search

Thanks for your help!

Hi Jenna,
Is this a repeated-measures design ( e.g. is "acquisition X vs. acquisition Y” trying to correct for a subject’s multiple scans ) or are they “site/scanner” EVs to correct for different locations/protocols?

Kind Regards

Hi Manuel,
Note that for Taylor’s suggestion ( using fslreorient2std ) the _contents_ of the other imags are unimportant ( unlike “normal” registration ) as the transformation is based on the s/q-form information. However if fslreorient2std cannot be used for some reason, then if the other modalities are perfectly aligned to the T2 ( i.e. same image dimensions, FOV etc ) a command of the form:

applywarp -I <alignedOtherModality> -r T2-skullstripped-fsl.nii.gz --premat=reorientation_2_fslstd.txt  -o <output_alinged>

should work - the image values will technically be trilinear-interpolated but on test images the outputs are identical - you could always add

 --interp=nn

to reduce the chance of interpolation-driven changes.

Hope this helps,
Kind Regards
Matthew


Hi Lin,

Are you sure the relative file path "reg/example_func2highres.mat" is valid"? It looks to like it should perhaps be "030_clean_1dot5smooth.feat/reg/example_func2highres.mat".

It also looks like you might be running low on RAM. Given that you are working within FMRIB, and are performing a task which is relatively expensive in terms of both computation and memory requirements (transforming a 4D image), you should probably be submitting this as a cluster job (and requesting how much RAM you expect to need), or running it on a different computer - jalapeno is intended to be used for submitting and monitoring jobs, not for running them.

Hi Paul,

 

Thank you for spotting that. However this was only one error I made when I wrote my last email.

 

Please kindly see a screenshot of the error appearing again when I just run one subject in the .feat directory.

 

Oddly enough, when I ran one single subject again, I got a different error message:

Could not open matrix file reg/example_func2highres.mat

I am also quite sure I have enough space on my scratch.
