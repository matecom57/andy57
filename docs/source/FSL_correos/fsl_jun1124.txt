Dear all,

I want to run probabilistic tractrography using a list of seeds (ROIs) 
saved in seeds_list.txt for each of my patients. I have ran successfully 
the following command for other patients, but now I get the following 
error for the PSP group (below is one single subject example only):

probtrackx2 --samples=merged     --mask=nodif_brain_epi_mask.nii     
--seed=seeds_list.txt     --out=probtrackx_BN     --network

Dear Saad,
thank you for your answer! I did not try to think of it that way, it was 
quite enlightening.
So, if I understand correctly, by converting it to absolute values I am 
getting left with just the "proclivities" of the eigenvector to each of 
the axes - for the price of losing the exact direction of the eigenvector?

Best regards,
Stan

Hi Paul,

Still the same error. 
I have tried to output more text to the log file to figure out what is 
wrong. I think it might be because I am using a university computer and 
have limited admin rights.

Hi Emil,

From the log file, it looks like the same python interpreter 
(/opt/anaconda3/bin/python3) was used for this latest attempt. Could you 
specifically try running the installer with "/usr/bin/python 
fslinstaller.py" ? Or, more generally, could you try running the installer 
with a python interpreter that is not from your anaconda installation?

INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN HEALTHCARE (AIiH)
4 - 6 September 2024, Swansea, UK
https://aiih.cc
(2nd CALL FOR ABSTRACT)

Submission deadline: Monday 1 July (FIRM)

1. INTRODUCTION
https://aiih.cc/abstracts/

AIiH 2024 welcomes late-breaking short abstract submissions to be included 
as poster or short spot-light presentation at the conference. This is to 
both enable fast dissemination of promising preliminary findings and 
encourage attendance by a broader audience of early career researchers 
(including research students), healthcare professionals, and industrial 
practitioners.

AIiH 2024 is a single-track conference with oral and poster presentations 
and will include a conference tutorial on generative DNNs and 5 keynote 
presentations. The conference will also feature a plenary session, which 
consists of 3 invited speakers who have extensive experience in related 
areas.

AIiH aims to provide a prominent platform for researchers and 
practitioners who are devoted to improving healthcare using modern 
artificial intelligence. We recognise that healthcare applications present 
complex and sometimes unique challenges across a wide spectrum, from 
ethics to technical developments, that generic AI methods are often 
inadequate. By creating this dedicated forum, we encourage discussions and 
disseminations of efficient and effective AI solutions and technologies 
for healthcare, and in turn we hope to influence the research, technology 
adoption, and decision making in healthcare.

Dear expert,

I'm trying to use easythresh_conj.sh 
(https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/nichols/scripts/fsl/easythresh_conj.sh) 
to perform a conjunction analysis, and I run into a problem that I have 
seen before on the forum, but that to my knowledge has not been resolved.

My current working directory is the most upper level of a gfeat directory 
and this is where the script is located -  it contains two copes, for 
which I want to perform a conjunction analysis on zstat1,

However, when I try:

./easythresh_conj.sh -s ./cope1.feat/stats/smoothness 
./cope1.feat/stats/zstat1.nii.gz ./cope2.feat/stats/zstat1.nii.gz 
./mask.nii.gz 2.3 0.01 grot

I only the help information returned but no results.
 
Weirdly enough if I run this incorrect command (supplying the mask twice):

./easythresh_conj.sh -s ./cope1.feat/stats/smoothness 
./cope1.feat/stats/zstat1.nii.gz ./cope2.feat/stats/zstat1.nii.gz 
./mask.nii.gz ./mask.nii.gz 2.3 0.01 grot
 
I get all kinds of errors but the scripts seems to perform a non-cluster 
corrected conjunction analysis, so I suspect that I am misunderstanding 
something about what arguments need to be provided in what order.

Thanks in advance for your time and best,

Jurriaan Witteman

Oh dear,

 

I am sorry about that. I haven't heard anyone else having problems like 
that, so hopefully it is something in your data that causes the problems.

 

Can I please ask you to collect all the files referred to on your eddy 
command line into one tar-ball, and upload that? You will soon receive an 
email with instructions where to upload it.

 

Best regards Jesper

Hi Stan – yes that’s right (and thank you for introducing the term 
“proclivities” to me)

 

Cheers

Saad

 

 

Hi Adriana,

If the orientation labels in your raw data are incorrect, then this 
indicates that a problem occurred during acquisition (e.g. a 
misconfiguration in the scanner software). You need to fix this before 
doing anything with your data. There are some instructions on how to do 
this safely in the FSL documentation at 
https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/docs/#/other/orientation?id=the-labels-in-fsleyes-are-wrong-or-missing

Once you have corrected your images (and are 100% positive that the image 
orientations are correctly labelled when you view them in FSLeyes), then 
you can proceed with your analysis, whatever that may be. 

It is not particularly important If the two images are slightly out of 
alignment when you view them in FSLeyes, and/or if FSLeyes warns you about 
them being of different orientations, as the standard preprocessing steps 
using topup and eddy will account for this difference in orientation.

Subject: Re: Image out of bounds in FSLeyes
 
Dear Paul,


Dear Yiling,
   You’re correct on the p-value threshold - it ultimately decides which 
voxels are significant ( using the corrected p-value outputs from 
randomise ). The “z-threshold” in the GUI will be _actually_ be applied to 
the permuted t-statistics when generating the distribution of 
cluster-sizes in randomise. Changing it from 3.1 to 2.3 will lower this 
t-threshold used by randomise. The cluster probability threshold is the 
p-value threshold, the full process is along the lines of:

Randomise thresholds the unpermuted t-statistic image by 3.1 ( the 
“z-threshold” ) and records the cluster sizes.
Process above is repeated under permutation - building up a distribution 
of cluster sizes.
Each voxel is then assigned a _corrected_ p-value based on the size of its 
cluster ( if any ) in the unpermuted case, using this distribution.
Significant voxels/clusters are reported based on the p-value threshold.

Hope this helps,
Kind Regards
Matthew

Hi Jesper,

 

got it.

And yes, invertibility and edges are an issue.

Cheers,
