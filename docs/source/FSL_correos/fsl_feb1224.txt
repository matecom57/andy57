### HIRING: Data Analyst / Data Scientist Position at the CDN Lab

The Unit on Computational Decision Neuroscience (CDN,
https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/research-conducted-at-nimh/research-areas/clinics-and-labs/edb/cdn
) at the National Institute of Mental Health is seeking a full-time
Data Scientist/Data Analyst.

The lab is focused on understanding the neural and computational bases
of adaptive and maladaptive decision-making and their relationship to
mental health. Current studies investigate how internal states lead to
biases in decision-making and how this is  exacerbated in mental
health disorders. Our approach involves a combination of computational
model-based tasks, questionnaires, biosensor data, fMRI, and
intracranial recordings. The main models of interest come from
neuroeconomics, reinforcement learning, Bayesian inference, signal
detection, and information theory.

The main tasks for this position include but are not restricted to
computational modeling of behavioral data from decision-making and
other cognitive tasks, statistical analysis of task-based, clinical,
physiological and neuroimaging data, as well as data visualization for
the purposes of scientific presentations, public communication, and
academic manuscripts. The candidate is expected to demonstrate
experience with best practices for the development of well-documented,
reproducible programming pipelines for data analysis, that facilitate
sharing and collaboration, and live up to our open-science philosophy,
as well as to our data management and sharing commitments at NIH.

No prior experience with psychiatry research is needed but a
familiarity with the constructs and models of interest in the lab
(value-based learning and decision-making, metacognition, belief
updating, emotion regulation, and/or effort-cost estimation) is
desirable, as these are universally important for understanding
adaptive healthy functioning and psychiatric disease.

This is an exciting opportunity for a candidate with established
programming and analytic skills to work at the cutting edge of
psychiatry research and computational cognitive neuroscience.

You can find more about our work and recent publications at

https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/research-conducted-at-nimh/research-areas/clinics-and-labs/edb/cdn

## Job Requirements:

- Assisting with setting up and managing analysis pipelines
- Conducting advanced analysis of behavioral, physiological, and
imaging data, including but not limited to computational modeling and
machine learning
- Integrating complex datasets across multiple modalities, including
fMRI, electrophysiology, biosensor data neuroendocrinology, behavior,
and self-report
- Assisting in data visualization for manuscripts and presentation of
results at scientific meetings
- Supporting/co-mentoring junior members of the lab on data analysis practices

## Qualifications:

- A PhD in neuroscience, cognitive science, psychology, computer
science, data science, statistics, engineering, or a related field
- Strong programming skills (ideally in Python, and/or MATLAB, R)
- Experience working within Linux environment and cloud computing
- An ability to work well in multidisciplinary and highly collaborative teams
- An interest in translational research
- A track record or potential for scholarly productivity
- Effective independent problem-solving and task prioritization

## Experience with any of the following is not required, but preferred:

- Computational modeling (mathematical optimization, reinforcement
learning, Bayesian inference, neuroeconomics or other types of
modeling of human/animal learning and decision-making)
- statistical inference (e.g. generalized linear models, mixed effect
models, state space models, survival analysis)
- Dynamic analysis of longitudinal or time series data (e.g.
neuroimaging, MEG, EEG, or neural recordings)
- Advanced statistical methods and machine learning

The data analyst will work under the supervision of Dr. Silvia
Lopez-Guzman on projects that aim to understand (1) the process of
adaptively evaluating options and committing to a choice; (2) how
changes in internal and motivational states may abnormally shape
decisions in individuals with and without psychopathology; and (3) how
cognitive and metacognitive resources support these adaptive or
maladaptive decision-making processes. The CDN lab leverages the rich
clinical resources and computational expertise across the NIH, and
collaborates actively with labs that specialize on addiction,
depression, anxiety, and pain. The lab is an active part of a growing
community of expert labs on learning and decision-making who work
together to improve our understanding from the circuits and behavioral
neuroscience level to the human cognitive and clinical levels, making
this a unique opportunity for any scientist with an interest in
decision science and computational psychiatry.

## How to Apply:

To apply, please send your CV and a cover letter to Dr. Silvia
Lopez-Guzman (silvia.lopezguzman@nih.gov ) with the subject “CDN Lab
Data Analyst App”. Inquiries about any aspect of the position are very
welcome!

Hi experts,

Recently, I wanted to register T1 to EPI image with epi_reg function. I used the following command line to perform this registration.

epi_reg \
--epi=epi.nii.gz \
--t1=T1.nii.gz \
--t1brain=T1_mask.nii.gz \
--out=epi_reg_d

But, based on the output (e.g. epi_reg_d.nii.gz), it seems there is something wrong with the registration process. Please see the results via this link (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1V1XP0vUbHU8_qwqCvvKM59JtPIwxfB5S/view?usp=sharing). When I run epi_reg, there is no bug reported. But, the registration seems not correct. Do you have any thoughts on this issue?

Thank you so much. Looking forward to your reply.

Best,
Cain

Hi Marina,
I think this display range is just to get a good visualisation for the comparison in this specific example. Normally for your data you’d adjust these values (or in some cases you might want to display with no thresholding).

Dear Michael,

I could solve the problem on my own. In the roi_stats.py script I changed in line 346 np.float to float

array = array.astype(float)

and on line 733 I deleted np.float

if isinstance(v, (float, np.float32, np.float64)):

after this small changes the oxford _asl_rois_stats script worked well.

Im trying to load the inia19 atlas to FSleyes. I am able to load the neuromaps image, however I want to load in the corresponding .txt file as a LUT. It contains something like

1 l_occipital_gyrus_(macaque) 47 129 147 255



However, when I go to Load LUT and select it, I get this error. Any fix?

An error occurred while loading /mnt/OSDisk/Users/a.stark/Desktop/fMRI Analysis/inia19/inia19-NeuroMaps.txt
Details: Cannot determine type of /mnt/OSDisk/Users/a.stark/Desktop/fMRI Analysis/inia19/inia19-NeuroMaps.txt

Hi Saad,
 
Just to let you know this issue was resolved. The problem was that the acquisition parameter files used had been set up for synb0-disco, which resulted in extra information in the data_eddy_para and data_unique_pes fields in the qc.json files.
 
Thank you for your time in helping to troubleshoot!

Hi all,

I'm running the most recent FSL version (6.0.7.7) on my iMac (macos sonoma) and was wondering whether there's any way to parallelise FEAT. I'm running my analyses on my iMac (i.e. not on the fmrib cluster) and would like FEAT to use more than one core. Is this at all possible?
Just to clarify, I know how to run multiple participants in parallel but I wonder how to make it that each participants' FEAT analysis can be distributed across multiple cores. I've already googled but couldn't find anything on the FSL website and tutorials so I wasn't sure if I missed anything obvious.

Any help is much appreciated!

Best
Lisa
