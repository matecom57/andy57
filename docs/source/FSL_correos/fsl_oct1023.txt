Apologies for cross-posting listservs

The University of Chicago’s Neurology Department is seeking a data scientist focused on neuroimaging in aging and Alzheimer’s disease. See the full job posting here.

University of Chicago’s new Healthy Aging & Alzheimer’s Research Care Center is focused on SuperAging, a phenotype of successful aging, and atypical Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia syndromes. Prior experience with Alzheimer’s disease or aging is not a requirement.

The primary responsibilities of the positions are to use analytical, statistical, and programming skills to help collect, curate, analyze, and interpret biomedical data, including neuroimaging and biomarker derivatives. The candidate will work alongside investigators and clinicians to develop data-driven solutions and answer scientific questions. See the full list of responsibilities in the job posting for more information.

Candidates should have some prior experience with neuroimaging software libraries, and Python and/or R. Experience with high-performance cluster shell scripting and schedulers, and machine learning libraries are desirable.

Hello.

I am trying to run eddy_qc with the following command:

eddy_quad dwi_post_eddy \-idx eddy_indices.txt \-par eddy_config.txt \-m nodif_brain_mask \-b bvals \-o eddy_qc \-v

I get the error below:

Hi, again

I have resting state data from individuals with depression. I don't want to separate them into groups, but correlate baseline resting state data (before treatment) with change in Hamilton score (score after treatment - score before treatment). For doing so, I followed all the steps described at https://git.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslnets until # Inspect hierarchical clustering on the full correlation matrix. Then, I included my GLM (attached) in the # Perform a GLM regression using randomise

 p_corr,p_uncorr = nets.glm(ts, Pnetmats, 'design_hdrspercdif_dem_chro_groupplus1_2_nogroup.mat', 'design_hdrspercdif_dem_chro_groupplus1_2_nogroup.con');

I got a significant result (attached), but the graph includes group 1 and group 2, and I don't have two groups. Is there something wrong?

As I have only one group doesn't make sense to # Train a classifier on edge strengths to differentiate your groups, but can I use it for correlating the Hamilton score change and the edge strengths?

I then used the # Display netmats interactively in a web browser - how can I label the nodes?


Thanks! I really appreciate your attention

Best,
Tamires


Hi FSL team,

I apply the structural analysis of UK biobank pipeline (bb_struct_init*) to some other datasets,
aiming at getting linearly registered brains to MNI space, in the end. In some of the datasets it
works well, but in others (IXI and CamCAN) I end up with very weird results. I dug into the code
and figured out that it all starts from the flirt command which calculates the affine, which is later
used in fnirt. Figure saws the result of applying the linear transformation to the original volume.
This is the code I use:

head_top=`robustfov -i T1_orig_ud | grep -v Final | head -n 1 | awk '{print $5}'`
fslmaths T1_orig_ud -roi 0 -1 0 -1 $head_top 170 0 1 T1_tmp       
                                                                                
#Run a (Recursive) brain extraction on the roi                                  
bet T1_tmp T1_tmp_brain -R                                        
                                                                                
#Reduces the FOV of T1_orig_ud by calculating a registration from T1_tmp_brain to ssref and applies it to T1_orig_ud
standard_space_roi T1_tmp_brain T1_tmp2 -maskNONE -ssref $FSLDIR/data/standard/MNI152_T1_1mm_brain -altinput T1_orig_ud -d
                                                                         
immv T1_tmp2 T1   
flirt -in T1 -ref T1_orig_ud -omat T1_to_T1_orig_ud.mat -schedule $FSLDIR/etc/flirtsch/xyztrans.sch·
convert_xfm -omat T1_orig_ud_to_T1.mat -inverse T1_to_T1_orig_ud.mat
convert_xfm -omat T1_to_MNI_linear.mat -concat T1_tmp2_tmp_to_std.mat T1_to_T1_orig_ud.mat

Any ideas of how I could to solve this so it works for all datasets?

Thank you in advance for your time and help,

Ok, so the SVS in the instructions is indicating for you to replace that with the path to your data. What is the full path to your MRS data converted using spec2nii?

Dear Will,

 

Some of the commands I tried are:

svs_segment -a /home/virtualboxdaniella/Documents/MRS_data/MRS_114/mp2rage_114.anat -o . metab.nii.gz 

svs_segment -a /home/virtualboxdaniella/Documents/MRS_data/MRS_114/mp2rage_114.anat -o . metab.nii.gz SVS

svs_segment -a "/home/virtualboxdaniella/Documents/MRS_data/MRS_114/mp2rage_114.anat" -o . metab.nii.gz 

svs_segment -a "/home/virtualboxdaniella/Documents/MRS_data/MRS_114/mp2rage_114.anat" -o . metab.nii.gz SVS

svs_segment -a "/home/virtualboxdaniella/Documents/MRS_data/MRS_114/mp2rage_114.anat" -o metab.nii.gz 

etc

 

I drop and drag the path to the anat directory so it should be correct. 

 

See also screenshot for what the error message may look like.

 

I have tried this on Ubuntu virtual box and on WSL, both resulting in similar error messages so I believe there is something wrong with my code. 

 

Thank you so much in advance.

Hi,

 

What’s the exact command you are inputting? The svs is probably indicating the path to one of the single voxel spectroscopy (SVS) files you have been processing.

Dear Will, 

 

Thank you for your response, it was very helpful and seems to have worked great! 

 

However, I have run into another problem with the svs_segment function. 

 

It seems to either not recognize the path specified after -a, or have trouble with the 'SVS' argument. In -h it is described that the 'SVS' argument at the end of the command line is necessary, and if I don't use it I get an error that it is indeed required. However, when I try to run the command followed by the 'SVS' argument it does not recognize 'SVS'. Do you have any idea what the problem could be? 

 

Thank you very much in advance.

Hi Daniëlla,

 

Yes, you are right that most of the pre-processing is already applied in DICOM and RDA (though the exact amount depends on the exact sequence). I’d suggest potentially running the HLSVD water removal and phase correction steps on this data. See steps #7 and #8 here: https://open.win.ox.ac.uk/pages/fslcourse/practicals/fsl_mrs/index.html#preprocessing

Hello, 

 

I am a student who is just starting out with MRS analysis. I am working with .RDA files from Siemens and I would like to know which FSL preprocessing steps I should use on these data files. 

 

I have tried using fsl_mrs_preproc, however, the .RDA files seem to be averaged already, resulting in an error. 

 

Thank you very much in advance!

Hi Anna,


Would you be able to try running the installer with the --conda option to see if that makes a difference? i.e.

python fslinstaller.py --conda

Given the relatively slow speed of your internet connection, I would still expect the installation to take at least 2.5 hours.

Paul

Hi Mariana,

This issue will be resolved if you update your FSL installation to the latest version.

Paul


Hi Georgios,

Do all of the input images have the same voxel orientation? If not, running fslreorient2std on all of your images before any processing (assuming that their anatomical labels are valid) can reduce the likelihood of registration failures.

Paul
