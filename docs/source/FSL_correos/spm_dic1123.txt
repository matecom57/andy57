What Christophe posted sounds very plausible. It also depends on whether you have done slice-timing correction or not - and if so to what slice you aligned it to.

Dear all,

I am doing Parametric Empirical Bayes (BMA = spm_dcm_peb_bmc(PEB)) according to Zeidman et al. (2019) for the first time. I have one between subject factor and two groups (HC and patients). Now I noticed that I get very different results connectivities after Bayesian Model Averaging depending on whether I have a
(1) first vector of 1s and a second, 'dummy' regressors of 0s and 1s OR
(2) again a first regressor of 1s and a second regressor of -1s and 1s.

I realise that the interpretation of the coefficient is somewhat different depending on whether I use dummy or effect coding (as in all GLMs). However, I get very different connections with sufficient evidence after Bayesian Model Averaging. I was wondering whether you could advice, which approach is most suitable in my case where I am basically looking for difference in connectivity between two groups?

Thank you very much in advance!

Best,
Susan

You may consider what is known as ‘hidden dummies’, which are not disclosed by the scanner, as opposed to the 'visible dummy scans'. Hidden dummies are hidden to the operator and may be 1 or 2, as it depends on the type of tissue chosen, and a different TR for those dummies may also be applied.

Hi everybody,

We are pleased to announce that the application portal is still open for the NIH funded 2024 session of the course, “Training in Advanced Statistical Methods in Neuroimaging and Genetics”.

 

We hope you pass this email on to your local neuroimaging community.

 

The course will start on Monday, April 15, 2024 and finish on April 26, 2024. We are happy to announce that the course is to be held in person, in Salt Lake City, Utah, United States at the University Guest House Conference Center. Our course also includes an ongoing continuing education portion.

 

The course is an intensive 2-weeks, about 8 hours per day of a mix of lectures and hands-on computer labs.

 

neurostatsbootcamp.org

 

The course cost is $3000 (see scholarship information below), which includes hotel accommodations at the Guest House (arrival on April 14 with departure on April 26), breakfast, lunch, day time snacks, three dinners out as a group, and the planned evening activities. All course attendees will arrange for their own transportation to Salt Lake City. The course cost does include a daily pass to the Salt Lake City Trax light rail/commuter system. (Please note that the course instructors' effort is supported by the NIH grant thus avoiding that cost being passed on to the course attendees. This course is strictly not-for-profit.)

Because of the limited size and advanced nature of the course, attendance is by application only – please make sure to fully read the website instructions. In general, applicants must be a US citizen, permanent resident, or with an appointment at a US institution, though we do have the ability to accommodate 3 to 6 individuals that do not meet this criteria. We anticipate the total class size to be between 22 and 25 students.

 

There are opportunities for scholarships which can partially offset hotel accommodations. These are based on true financial need and you will be instructed how to apply if you are admitted to the course.

Dear Rob,

 

I’m not sure that the segment routine has been optimized for PET. I’d say it isn’t, given how segment works and how PET activity is spread.

Maybe with very new systems with much higher resolution and motion correction.

Why do you want to segment PET images? Which tracer by the way?

Hey everyone,

i am working on ROI Analsysis for the mirror neuron system at the moment and am trying to use custom Atlases,
is there a option to import those or any code i can use to import atlases into the CAT12 GUI?

I tried with the help of this, but the code has aged too much i think https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=spm;e2cb99a1.1804
Also i tried just writing the Atlases into the cat_default after adding them into the atlas folder, but that seems to create many errors and
leaves me not being abled to open CAT12, until i take the lines out of the file.

Would be super happy if u got any tips on how i can go on.

Hi Enrique,

 

I’d like to bring to your attention this work of mine from 2018 about the subject of normalizing PET images using their CT scan with SPM unified segmentation.

Low-dose CT for the spatial normalization of PET images: A validation procedure for amyloid-PET semi-quantification - ScienceDirect

NeuroImage: Clinical, Volume 20, 2018, Pages 153-160

 

With FDG I generally prefer using the old-normalization, but I’ve found that CT-based normalization works “well enough” even with attenuation correction CT. Of course you don’t see atrophy anywhere as good as with MR… But it still works quite well for most PET related stuff!

 

Let me know if you have any question!

 

Luca

Oggetto: [SPM] CT as a anatomicall reference

 

Hello everyone,

 

I'm in the process of implementing SPM (Statistical Parametric Mapping) analysis for brain FDG PET-CT images, and I'm looking to gain a deeper understanding of the algorithm's limitations when it comes to normalization using an Atlas brain. Most of the examples and tutorials I've come across are based on MRI anatomical references, and I'm wondering if the same process can be applied to PET-CT images. Specifically, I have a couple of questions:

 

Is it feasible to perform the preprocessing steps of the SPM algorithm on PET-CT images?

 

Can PET-CT images be normalized to an atlas, such as MCIN or any that the SPM algorithm supports?

 

I'd greatly appreciate any insights or guidance on this matter. Thank you!​

We are currently planning a new event-related fMRI study, which will involve 6 task blocks per session. We would like to perform univariate activation and multivariate (MVPA) decoding analyses, as well as task-related functional/effective connectivity analyses such as PPI and DCM. Now, we are wondering whether it would be better to do continuous scanning (1 run) with 6 blocks that are separated by 20-second rest periods, or to do 6 runs (between which the scanner is stopped)?

Some people I've talked to argue that task-based functional connectivity analyses (e.g. PPI, DCM) should be performed on a continuous timeseries, and concatenating runs would not be good. This speaks for continuous scanning with 6 blocks.

For MVPA decoding, on the other hand, people seem to prefer leave-one-RUN-out cross validation to leave-one-BLOCK-out cross validation to ensure that training and test data are independent. This would speak for 6 runs.

A compromise would be 2 runs with 3 blocks each.

Which option would you prefer?

Thanks in advance and all the best,
Philipp

Dear Nancy,

could you be off by about half a TR ?
Not exactly sure why this would happen but maybe:
the scan trigger is sent at half TR ? Weird but why not...
the microtime resolution and onset in the GLM definition ("Timing parameters") have been poorly/erroneously defined, such that events are timed half a TR toff? 

BTW knowing if you have to remove or add some 1-1.5s may help figuring out where things are going astray...

Christophe

We are having the craziest time with our newest study trying to match our onsets with the hrf.
We have checked the timing on the task (we, the scanner techs, and physicists at our imaging center) and it is 100% correct. All onsets are accurate. Yet when we run our model and look for basic neural activity vs. rest baseline as we have always done, we do not get a large response in occipital cortex, nor do we get motor activity. Yet, if we move the onset timing back 1.5 seconds the motor activity is large and significant - as is activity in the visual cortex. Activity in this model is exactly as I would expect. For reference, this is a memory task where participants look at pictures and make a button response corresponding to their memory decision (something I have done a dozen times before). We have run the model (with the accurate onset convolved with the default hrf in SPM12) on 2 versions of SPM12 and across 3 pilot subjects. The results are always the same whereby moving the onset back 1.5 second provides the most robust neural activity at baseline and captures motor activity).....it is the same every time.
Does anyone have any thoughts? Given that I have no doubt about the onsets, I am thinking that for whatever reason the match with the SPM12 hrf is just not working. (Why I dunno)

I am considering adjusting the format/shape of the hrf in SPM to capture our neural activity and was wondering if anyone has done this before and if you have any advice on how to adjust the spm_hrf script (i.e., a more specific understanding of what changing the variables will do)

Some MR-scanners have 'hidden dummy scans' in the beginning of the scanning protocol, that are not resulting in saved images. In some cases, the number of dummies (typically 2 or 3 TRs) also depend on which tissue type that is selected. The intention is to remove the initial relaxation effects, prior to the development of steady state. Contact your MR-scanner manufacturer to resolve if that is indeed the case with your data.
