I seem to be having a similar problem to the one listed here.

When running tbss_1_preproc on my FA.nii.gz files I get an error message and the fslmaths step to write the FA files to the newly created FA folder does not work.

Finding this previous issue I attempted this fix: FSLOUTPUTTYPE=NIFTI; for f in *.nii.gz; do imcp $f $f; done;

Which created the new *.nii files, but which did not solve my problem.

I then tried working through the first parts of the tbss_1_preproc script, as suggested.

running this step

>>$ X=`${FSLDIR}/bin/fslval sub-old69_ses-01_FA.nii dim1`; X=`echo "$X 2 - p" | dc -`

gave me this error

Fatal error: cannot open file: -
    Function: (main)
Which matches with the first error I see when I try to run 'tbss_1_preproc' on my FA files.

Breaking this command down,

>>$ X=`${FSLDIR}/bin/fslval sub-old69_ses-01_FA.nii dim1`;
Gives no error, and
>>$ echo $X
works and gives me the value of X as 96.

>>$ X=`echo "$X 2 - p" | dc -`
however gives me the error message

Fatal error: cannot open file: -
    Function: (main)
 
So it seems this command is not working as excpected.

I'm on a 2019, 2.4 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i5 Macbook Pro, running Ventura 13.0.1. with bash 5.1. and python 3.7.7

Any ideas or tips that I can try to get this to work?
