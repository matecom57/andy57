Hello, 

Dtiexolorer is an excellent alternative for the distortion correction! It uses t1/t2wi!

Hi all,

I need to generate a figure within the 3D view of fsleyes (ver 1.5.0).
I can load the nifty file (T1), tck (tracks), and pial surface (fs output) successfully.
However, I can't get the vtk file I created. I have tried to generate vtk file using itksnap or 3dslicer, but no luck and get the error below.
The vtk file is coming from a simple binary mask (nifti format).

3dSlicer: "Details: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xde in position 99: invalid continuation byte"
itksnap: "Details: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '0.643618'"
Note, these vtk files are fine, I can open them properly in SurfIce.

Did I miss anything when converting or loading the vtk files? I can share the file if needed.
The alternative question is: is there a way to convert a binary mask to vtk file that is compatible with fsleyes?

Thanks,
Chao

I agree with Jesper.  This is the first of these fieldmap-less distortion correction methods that actually looks good.  They clearly show the best result compared to a gold standard correction.

Dear Marina,

 

just to add to Maurizio’s suggestion there is also the method by Kurt Schilling (Distortion correction of diffusion weighted MRI without reverse phase-encoding scans or field-maps, Schilling et al.). They create a synthetic, undistorted, EPI image from an anatomical scan (T1), and that can then be used in topup together with the actual distorted EPI image. It has the advantage that after that first step you can then proceed with your processing as if you had had the two phase-encoding directions.

 

I should add that I haven’t actually tried the method myself, but had heard good things about it.

 

Best regards Jesper

Hi Paul,
  The output of "which stat" shows, "/usr/local/bin/stat", which is different with "/usr/bin/stat".
   I would try with your suggestion and response you.

Thanks

Kangcheng

########################################################################

Hi Kangcheng,

I think that you might have a non-standard "stat" command which is masking the system one - could you send me the output of running "which stat" in a terminal?

If the output is not "/usr/bin/stat", would you be able to try the installation again, with these commands?

export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH
python3.7 fslinstaller.py

Hi Daisuke,

Sorry - this is a bug which we will fix for the next FSL version. In the meantime, you could pass the file extension as part of the glob pattern, e.g. "imrm img_????.nii.gz"

Hello,
I was using feat for higher-level analysis, and in the Data tab, I came across the following problems:
1. I could not change the input of numbers by typing (no response when in i press the numbers on my keyboard), but have to use the up/down button
2. In the select feat directories tab, I pressed PASTE, but could not paste (with control y) the list of groups, or type into the window.
 
I am using Mac with M1 chip, mac OS 13, XQuartz is up-to-date.
Thank you,

Dear FSL List members,

On Ubuntu 22.04 LST and FSL 6.0.6.2, the pattern matching character
("?") seems not to work as intended in "imrm" using bash.
https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Pattern-Matching.html#Pattern-Matching

Any changes in imrm or am I missing something?

EXAMPLE CODE:
---------------------------------------------------
#!/bin/bash
mkdir temp; cd temp
touch test_1_000{1,2,3,4}.nii.gz  # three-zero nii.gz
touch test_1_000{1,2,3,4}.bval    # three-zero bval
touch test_1_0000{1,2,3,4}.nii.gz # four-zero nii.gz
ls

# Had deleted image files in FSL 6.0.4 or earlier
# but do not delete them in FSL 6.0.6.2
imrm test_1_???? # Fail, not delete anything
ls
imrm test_1_????.* # OK, delete three-zero nii.gz, while preserving
four-zero nii.gz
ls

Dear respected experts,

I have created a binarized mask created from adding ICA components output from Melodic. I created this using fslmaths mask1.nii.gz -add mask2.nii.gz -add mask3.nii.gz -bin out.nii.gz. I would like to merge this onto an anatomical image so that they are stored as the same file versus displaying the mask as an overlay. I would appreciate if you could inform me on the simplest way to go about doing this.

Thank you!

Dear Maurizio,
Thank you for your kind answer. I don't know if I should have to find a 'FUGUE' button directly in the FSL initial GUI. Looking for it I've found that in FEAT Tool the Pre-stats section includes B0 unwarping that is carried out using a combination of BBR and FUGUE (I'm using FSL FEAT v6.00). Is this the right way or is there a command-line instruction run by the terminal? If so, I noticed the fieldmap is required. Is something that I have to find among my acquired data or can I create it (the acquisition machine is not Siemens)?
Thank you in advance if you want to clarify
Marina

Hi Kangcheng,

Would you be able to run:

  sudo chown -R $USER:$USER ~/.conda/

entering your password when prompted, and then try installing FSL again?

Thanks for your response, Paul.

I have installed fsl (5.0.6) when I used macos with high sierra. I recently update the system and find the fslview does not work. Then,  I want to reinstall  fsl with lastest version. It seems the environment still contains the revious fsl 5.0.6. 

Best wishes

Kangcheng
