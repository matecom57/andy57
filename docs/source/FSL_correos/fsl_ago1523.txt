I see...as for running applytopup, I'm a little unsure as to how the inindex would be made:

If the topup results I'm using are coming from AP-PA fieldmaps with an acqparams.txt file as follows:

0 -1 0 0.0593
0 1 0 0.5893

and the data I want to correct is just functional data  (300 volumes, all in the AP direction), how would I determine --inindex?

Best,

Noah

Hello!

I'm trying to run solely EPI correction for functional data. Typically, I'll run topup to get fieldmaps to be inputted into FEAT, but I want to use a different pipeline for that preprocessing, which only requires EPI correction prior. I'm wondering if anyone can help me with a step by step for FUGUE? I have a mag image (from topup), and what I believe is a phase image (the fieldcoef output, also from topup). I am unsure about finding the deltaTE, as the AP and PA fieldmap json files give identical TE.

Could anyone provide any help with this?

Hi Sam,

This does look like an issue with the data set, and looks like a mac-specific issue, as I have reproduced the crash on M1 and Intel macs, but melodic runs fine on Linux. I'll look into this further and get back to you.

Hello,

I have brain volumes (T2W) that I am using to segment certain structures in the WM. I want to visualize these structures in different subcortical regions of the brain. For this, I tried registering my volumes to the MNI152 space using FSL FLIRT.

While FLIRT works well using the original unprocessed images and gives me a transformation matrix as well, I am not able to use this matrix in Matlab to replicate the transformation on pre-processed images (possibly due to the change in header files and due to different co-ordinate space). 

I've also tried changing the co-ordinate space by;

% Create a conversion matrix to switch between FSL's and MATLAB's coordinate conventions convert_mat = [-1 0 0 size(img,1)/2; 0 -1 0 size(img,2)/2; 0 0 1 size(img,3)/2; 0 0 0 1]; 

% Convert the FLIRT matrix to MATLAB's space
M_matlab = convert_mat \ F * convert_mat;

tform = affine3d(M_matlab);

% Transform your image using the tform object
transformed_img = imwarp(img, tform);

Yet i cannot replicate the transform.

Could you please help?

Thank You
Yours Sincerely

Zoheb Ahasan


Hi Paul,

Thanks or the reply. I'm trying to build atlas and this is just the preprocess of the data. My plan was to align/center all the data and then use voxel-wise average to build template, and then pairwise registration, and so on. My initial thought was to align the data with an atlas in MNI space. But my professor told me to "just center all the volumes without changing the content," plus there's no proper atlas that allows me to align with. 

My approach now is to find a volume that looks relatively in the middle and align all the other volumes with it. Then apply each saved transformation to the segmented version of volumes. But, as you said, the change of content is unavoidable. 

Thanks

Hi Guyu,

Can you give more details as to why you are trying to accomplish this?

Regardless, whenever you resample one image into the space of another, trhe image data is going to be changed by way of the resampling/interpolation process. There is no way to avoid this. If you don't want to change your data at all, you can use FLIRT to calculate, but not apply, the transformation.

Hi,

I have a set of segmented and preprocessed brain 3D volume. If my goal is just to center all the data without changing the brain's content and shape, can I still use FLIRT? DOF 6 seems still changing the content of brain. Maybe just the transaction with DOF 3? In this case, what would be a proper reference? Should I just pick one that looks like in the middle of the space and use that data as a reference? Since I don't need to transfer between space or change brain in anyway, reference volume seems less useful/important in this case? Center rather than align seems to be a better description of my goal. Is there a better tool for center?

Thanks

Hi, thanks in advance for your replies!

ICA-AROMA suggest that the fmri data should be smoothed before. But i want to perform the Degree Centrality analysis (DC) then, which requires the preprocessing steps don't include smoothing. Is there any ways to solve this conflict? or can I input the unsmoothed data into ICA-AROMA?

Hi, 
after defining nodes, extracting timeseries from nodes and creating images from nodes (https://open.win.ox.ac.uk/pages/fsl/analysis-course-practicals/fslnets/), I followed the instructions for Fslnets in python  https://git.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslnets

the 
ts = nets.load('./groupICA100.dr/', 0.72, thumbnaildir='./groupICA100.sum/')


is returning the error:

Hi Noah,

If registration has completed successfully, that file should be in:

<your_analysis>.feat/reg/ example_func2standard.mat

Note that the file begins with example_func2, not example_fun2.

Hi Eugenie,

Hello,

I have a question regarding my output using FSL randomise with TFCE.

I seem to get very large clusters when applying TFCE, which does not appear when applying, for example, voxel-based correction. I have attached screenshots of the tstat and pstat (red/yellow) map from the randomise with TFCE and the pstat from the randomise with voxel correction (black), as well as the cluster tables (TFCE-left, voxel-right) showing the cluster sizes. To me, this output seems strange that the surviving clusters would be so large, even using TFCE. Thus, I wanted to ask whether this indeed a strange outcome, or whether clusters this large might be expected with TFCE?

Many thanks and best wishes,
Afton Nelson

Hi Josie,

 

I think you could try the options below:

 

--vxl                        list of numbers indicating voxelwise EVs position in the design matrix (list order corresponds to files in vxf option).

--vxf                       list of 4D images containing voxelwise EVs (list order corresponds to numbers in vxl option).

 

Best wishes,

David
