Hi Paul,

 

will try (not this week but soon) and keep you posted.

Btw, changing to wayland did result in the same display.

Hi Andreas,

I don't have access to a high-DPI display running native Linux, so can't experiment. But you could try installing 
a newer version of FSLeyes - at the moment you will need to install it into a separate conda environment, using a 
command such as:

$FSLDIR/bin/conda create -p ~/fsleyes-env fsleyes

changing ~/fsleyes-env to a location of your preference, and then calling  that version instead of the one in 
$FSLDIR.

Hi Paul,
I am on native Ubuntu 22, not WSL. It runs on X11 but I could switch to Wayland.
Cheers,
Andreas

Hi Andreas,

What X server are you using? I can't reproduce this issue when using vcxsrv, or the built-in WSL Wayland server.

Note that, as of the next FSL release, it should no longer be necessary to install a separate X server when 
installing FSL in WSL.

Hi PAul,



sorry - I mean the icons in the screenshot attached.

These are quite small on my screen, presumably due to the high inherent resolution of the display.

I have already upscaled to 200% but that does not increase these icons within fsleyes.

Is there a way to get these bigger?



Thanks!

Cheers-

Andreas

Hi,

how can I increase the icons in second row toolbar of fsleyes (i.e.
where the movie mode etc. is) in ubuntu 22? Is there a solution to get
these bigger?

Thx and cheers,

Dear FSL users,
                        We are pleased to announce the release of FSL 6.0.7.12.

Release highlights:

* Improvements to running bet4animal on MacOS, courtesy of Takuya Hayashi.
* Bug fix to invwarp which should result in major performance improvements.
* A separate X server is no longer required when installing FSL into a WSL2 environment.
* topup: Some fields will have small improvements to boundary slices.

The full changelog can be found at:

https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/docs/#/development/history/changelog-6.0.7.12.md

This update can be downloaded via:

https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsldownloads_registration

Alternatively there is an experimental script in post-6.0.6 versions of FSL:

$FSLDIR/bin/update_fsl_release

which will try to perform an in-place upgrade, this should be a faster install process, but as script is still in 
beta please use the link above if you encounter any problems.

Kind Regards
Matthew

Hi,

I am trying to make myself familiar with fslpy and try to run feat from python. I see a difference how feat 
behaves when calling it from cmd (bash) and from python script.

I have rs_fmri.nii.gz and mprage.nii.gz in /data directory and corresponding path entries in design.fsf. 

1. bash
/opt/fsl/bin/feat /data/design.fsf
This starts the feat and creates working directory /data/rs_fmri.ica, where all the ICA outputs are stored

2. python

from fsl.wrappers import feat as feat

feat('/data/design.fsf')
I see feat running in htop, but there is no /data/rs_fmri.ica created. Searching entire harddrive does not find 
any outptuts like report.html

Thanks for hints,

Martin


Hi Andreas,

Unfortunately this is due to some breaking changes in the latest numpy release (2.0). I'm working on updating the 
FSLeyes code, but in the meantime you could downgrade the version of numpy that you have installed - you should 
be able to use a command such as:

$FSLDIR/bin/conda install -p ~/fsleyes-env "numpy=1.*"

Hi Ruiqing

 

Yes that looks about right. You can change the max intensity modulation if you want to make it look nicer. You 
can also see the command line that would generate this display through the Menu ( Settings -> Ortho View 1 -> 
Show command line for scene)
I am not sure if there is a NIFTI-compatible format for saving the combined FA-V1 map…

Hi Mariana

 

If you want to be sure that you are providing the correct input file, why not give the full path to the file?

 

Cheers

I know you are really backed up now due to the FSL course in Osaka, but I wonder if Matthew has had the time to 
look at my fill-holes question? I actually did make it work using 'imfill' in Matlab slice-by-slice, but I just 
find it so confusing that the fslmaths command -fillh does nothing to the image. Also, the niftiwrite-command i 
matlab changes the space of the images (even if one in the output includes the 'info' tag from the niftiinfo of 
the input image) and one has to realign them to the previous space to not get warnings pertaining coordinates. It 
is the z-coordinates that are translated; hence the volume is parallely moved upwards in the z-direction compared 
to the input mask volume. So I would like to, if possible, to stay in FSL space while performing the filling.

hi everyone, 
recently after a major Windows 11 update, I can not launch fsl in my wsl ubunto machine and encounter the 
following error:

do you have any idea to troubleshoot this error?

I appreciate any help you can provide,

Dear Maedeh,
For your first question: The model allows for each subject to have an individual “baseline” response plus the 
common A/B condition response. These individual variance(s) are explained by columns 2-9, while the first column 
is modelling the condition response ( the EV of interest ). A separate column is needed for each subject, so in 
this case 8 extra columns are needed.

For the second question: Yes you can model as many groups as needed, e.g.

1 0 0 0
1 0 0 0
…….
0 1 0 0
0 1 0 0
…….
0 0 1 0
0 0 1 0
…….
0 0 0 1
0 0 0 1

and add t-contrasts as required. You may want to add an f-test on enough contrasts to “span” the groups ( e.g. on 
1 -1 0 0, 0 1 -1 0, 0 0 1 -1 ) and use that to determine significance ( if want to control the error rate across 
contrasts ).

Hope this helps,
Kind Regards
Matthew

Dear Matthew
Thank you very much for your help. 
I have 2 more questions question regarding 2 sample paired ttest. and unpaired ttest.
1- For example if I have 9 subjects under condition A and the same 9 under condition B. How would be the design 
and contrast? I have read the documentation in FSL site: 
Two-Sample Paired T-test (Paired Two-Group Difference)
We will follow the setup in the FEAT manual where we have a group of 8 subjects scanned under two different 
conditions, A and B. Condition A will be entered as the first 8 inputs, and condition B as the second 8 inputs, 
with the subjects in the same order in each case (ordering is, naturally, very important).

The design matrix (design.mat) looks like



Dear Emil,
It looks like you already have a conda environment installed - do you have an existing  “.condarc” file in your 
$HOME directory, as this could be overriding some of the installer’s behaviour?
