Thanks for the update Shaun. I talked to our HPC cluster admin and apparently they cannot do a an in-place update of FSL subprograms, they can only re-install the whole FSL package. They did this yesterday, but xtract_qc is still presenting the same error so I assume that the re-install did not include the updated xtract_qc. Is there another way to get the xtract_qc updated as part of the installation process of FSL 6.0.7.8?

Hi Paul,

After using a different network I have downloaded FSL succes on my Mac. However when I am attempting to run checks to assess if FSL is running correctly, it seems to not be doing so (i logged out then logged back into my terminal). Attached below is the FSL directory in my system at the moment, and my attempts to run some commands which failed. Could you please advise on this? Many thanks, Sean 


Yes, oxford_asl adds these ROIs into the region analysis script using the following options:

--roi-native gmmask_pure_cort.nii.gz wmmask_pure_cereb.nii.gz

You can do the same in your manual run, however one slight problem is that these ROIs are saved in the output under different names to the ones used internally in oxford_asl. They are saved as native_space/cortical_gm_roi and native_space/cerebral_wm_roi. If you pass these to the ROI analysis script using --roi-native then you will get the same numbers but the naming (which is derived from the filename) will be different.

So if you really want something identical to what oxford_asl produces you'll have to rename these two files to gmmask_pure_cort and wmmask_pure_cereb and then pass them to the script. Bit of a hassle but it should deliver the same output.

Hope this makes sense
Martin

Hi Martin,

you are right. I tried both approaches with another project and yielded the same results. There might be an error in my other script (I use GNU parallel to run many subjects in parallel, maybe there is something wrong in scripting).  However, I noticed that the csv files in the oxford_asl approach contain gmmask_pure_cort and wmmask_pure_cereb, which is not present in the oxford_asl_roi_stats approach. This might be problematic when someone extracts values from the csv file in certain rows using both approaches.

Best,
Ralf

Hi Roman,

I can't quite tell from the screenshot, but it looks like you have interpolation enabled, which will cause smoothing across voxels.

Subject: [FSL] fsleyes: incorrect gray level
 
Dear Paul,
Dear FSL developers,

I noticed that fsleyes sometimes does not show gray (perhaps color in general) correctly.
Loaded is a NIFTI file with two time points in it. Volume=0 is T1W image, volume=1 is a mask of only 0s and 1s. As you can see on the image, pixel brightness at crosshairs is gray despite value reads 1 and should be white (max of brightness range).

Does this mean that T1W image from volume=0 somehow bleeds through?

Thank you,

Roman



Dear FSL experts,

I have come across a problem that I am having some difficulty resolving in the DWI dataset I am working with. I would like to have your opinion on it.

Providing a brief overview:

1. My sequence consists of:
- 1 acquisition of b0 AP (7 volumes)
- 1 acquisition of b0 PA (2 volumes)
- 1 acquisition of 1 b0 AP, 32 b1000, and 32 b2000 (65 volumes)
In my case, I am only using the b0 that was acquired with the other b values for reasons related to the scanner (the separately acquired b0s had different intensities from the other acquired b0).

2. I denoised and preprocessed the data with PCA, Gibbs unringing, topup, and eddy.

3. I calculated a DKIfit, and in some of the subjects, such as the one I am sending attached, there were very high FA values (0.9999, I even found FA values > 1), so I tried to identify the origin of the problem. I went back to the raw data, where I found voxels (coinciding with those with high FA) where the intensity of the b0 volume was higher than the intensity of the b1000, which I found quite strange.

4. I discussed this 'artifact' in the b0 with the scanner technician, who raised the hypothesis that it could be a scanner reconstruction problem, with no clear resolution possible.

Have you ever encountered an error like this? If so, is there any possible solution/correction? I am also attaching the subject's nifti file in case it is useful.

Thank you very much for all your assistance.

Best regards,
Nelson

Hi all!

I hope you are well, and thank you for FSL and a place to ask questions!

I have some quick questions regarding the different ways to go about non-FA TBSS.

First, I know that, with tbss_non_fa, it adapts the tbss_skeleton command for its final component to also have the -a flag for alternative 4D data. That said, when I ran this command for my various parameters:

${FSLDIR}/bin/tbss_skeleton -i mean_FA -p $thresh mean_FA_skeleton_mask_dst ${FSLDIR}/data/standard/LowerCingulum_1mm all_FA all_${ALTIM}_skeletonised -a all_$ALTIM

My outputted skeleton (all_skeletonised) had different numbers of voxels for each subject. For me, it's super important that they have the same number for strong comparisons since I'm performing multi-time point comparisons for the same subject, along with inter-subject comparisons.

Second, I normally run tbss_skeleton with an adaption similar to the post here:  https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=fsl;738f1ede.1306, but I did not see another message beyond that one. I take my other DTI metric data after running the rest of TBSS processing and provide it with all_parameter data per parameter (AD, MD, RD, etc.). This gives me the same skeleton per subject, but the values are VERY different. For example, in the case of RD, my values were much higher with this route compared to the tbss_non_fa route with my all_RD values applied with the -a flag. Furthermore, they were especially high around the ventricles and such.

We also cross-checked those analyses and the parameter data compared to the subject's official parameter maps (non-skeletonised), and doing normal tbss_skeleton but giving it the all_parameter values had different values on the skeleton compared to the values for the same subject on the native parameter map.

Why would these two techniques be so different and provide wildly different values for the same parameter? What makes them different? They do seem to be somewhat on an order of magnitude different, so is there some scaling that's applied?

Further, why doesn't tbss_non_fa keep the same voxels on the skeleton as doing tbss on the FA data normally does?

Our logic for these analyses felt sound, but is there something in the processing code that we're missing that would generate different results?

Finally, what is the search rule mask used for in tbss_skeleton? Should I try a different mask for this, and does it change anything or have a big impact on tbss_skeleton? I have always used the LowerCingulum_1mm, but maybe this is a problem for different data. Should I try to provide a different sort of mask like one for the ventricles?

Thank you so much for your time and any help you can provide. I really appreciate it, and I thank you for your time and for these wonderful tools that I use so often!

Take care,
Lisette


Dear Matthew,

Images with validity masks are all 0s and 1s: 1 in pixels where data is valid, 0 is where data is invalid. Yes, they are subject specific and EV specific.

Perhaps to give artificial example, I have a model:

FA = age + sex + CBF + fMRI

Each subject has 3 images that come from 3 acquisitions with different FOVs. Thus, there are voxels where all 3 are valid. There are voxels where FA and CBF are valid, but fMRI is not and so on. These combinations vary from subject to subject. That is, there are voxels where FA for all subjects and all EVs is valid. There are voxels where FA and EVs are valid but only for some subjects. And there are voxels where some FA/EVs are valid some are not.

Dear Roman,
Can you confirm how the validity masks are coded ( e.g. what does 0 and 1 mean ), if they are subject specific, and if the validity is in/exclusive ( e.g. can a brain voxel have any combination of EV1/EV2 validity )?

Kind Regards

Dear FSL developers and users,

I would like to use randomise with several (say two) voxel-dependent EV (aka images). Each of them has their validity masks (FOV over which they were measured). As I understand, the design matrix will have two columns for the EVs themselves and two sets of identity matrixes for confounding. For example, if I have 4 subjects:

1 1   1 0 0 0   1 0 0 0
1 1   0 1 0 0   0 1 0 0
1 1   0 0 1 0   0 0 1 0
1 1   0 0 0 1   0 0 0 1

The contrast file would be, for example (I am interested in effects of the two EVs):

1 0   0 0 0 0   0 0 0 0
0 1   0 0 0 0   0 0 0 0

To supply data to randomise, I will create 4D NIFTI with EV1, a separate 4D NIFTI with EV2 and two separate 4D NIFTIs with the confounding validity masks CONF1 and CONF2.

The call to randomise will then be, and this is the crux of the question:

ransomise --vxf ev1.nii.gz ev2.nii.gz conf1.nii.gz conf2.nii.gz --vxl 1 2 -3 -4

Is the above logic correct?

In other words, the identity matrix in the design that sets up confounding is counted as one when used in --vxl list.

Equivalently, if design matrix first lists confounders and then EVs:

1 0 0 0   1 0 0 0   1 1
0 1 0 0   0 1 0 0   1 1
0 0 1 0   0 0 1 0   1 1
0 0 0 1   0 0 0 1   1 1

the contrast will be

0 0 0 0   0 0 0 0   1 0
0 0 0 0   0 0 0 0   0 1

and the call:

ransomise --vxf conf1.nii.gz conf2.nii.gz  ev1.nii.gz ev2.nii.gz --vxl -1 -2 3 4

Is that right?

Hi Martin,

you are right. I tried both approaches with another project and yielded the same results. There might be an error in my other script (I use GNU parallel to run many subjects in parallel, maybe there is something wrong in scripting).  However, I noticed that the csv files in the oxford_asl approach contain gmmask_pure_cort and wmmask_pure_cereb, which is not present in the oxford_asl_roi_stats approach. This might be problematic when someone extracts values from the csv file in certain rows using both approaches.

Hi Ralf,

I just tried this and got the same results by running the script manually. The command line I used was:

oxford_asl_roi_stats --oxasl-output oxford_asl_output/native_space/ --fslanat T1.anat --output roi_stats_test --add-standard-atlases

Is this the same as what you're doing? And did your oxford_asl run use the same fslanat output?

Only other thing I can think is whether you could be comparing PV corrected results in native_space/pvcorr with non-PVC results in native_space?

Dear Victoria,

 

    Thank you for the advice and explanation! I have one follow-up question regarding your explanation for why the rotations would differ when the first shell was preprocessed alone compared to when it was preprocessed combined with the second shell. In both cases the b=0 volume used for eddy was the first b=0 volume from the first shell so would this mean the bvec values should be the same for the first shell in both scenarios because it is relative to the same b=0 volume, or is there something about the inclusion of the volumes from the second shell that changes the values because of the where the set of volume is relative to the first b=0? I just want to make sure I am understanding correctly to ensure I don't overlook any potential red flags that something has gone awry.

    

if the reference scan (the first b0 if you not specify otherwise) is the same for the two runs of eddy you would expect the rotated bvecs to be "the same". I write "the same" since they will not be identical. Adding the second shell will have an impact both on the relative rotations within the shell, since the predictions are now based on data from both shells. And also of the rotation of the whole shell relative to the b=0 scans since eddy will now calculate the rigid-body transforms b0<->S1, b0<->S2 and S1<->S2 and use an amalgam of all to work out the b0<->S1 transform.

 

BUT, I would expect those differences to be very small. Well below a degree. If you see any more than that I expect something has gone wrong. You can either calculate the angle between each pair of bvecs in the two rotations, or you can use plot3 in Matlab to lay the two sets out on the sphere. Both would give you a good idea of if there is a problem or not.

 

Jesper

 

 

 

 

    Thanks!

Hi Roberto,
                 The masks are not specifically anatomical but removing voxels with ( essentially ) no variance. For one of the problematic subjects you can re-run the commands

fslmaths <subjectData> -Tstd mask1
fslmaths <subjectData> -Tstd -bin mask2

To check both the temporal standard-deviation of that image ( mask1 ) and the binarised version that dual_regression would use ( mask2 ). You can also check the time-series view of brain voxels for the same subject with FSLeyes to see what the in-brain signals look like.

I would start by inspecting the data for these subjects to see if ( e.g. ) pre-processing has failed. Note that as you have a lot of subjects ( ~3000 ) the full dual_regression analysis will take a while to complete - depending on if you’re running on an HPC cluster etc.

Hi Matthew

Thanks for your assistance. I have some follow up questions. Firstly, I don't entirely understand the output of dual regression. Are the volumes of maskALL supposed to represent anatomical masks of each subject? The subjects with problematic data are blank (such as volume 57 that you showed), but the others don't look like brains (such as volume 56 below). Also, the "dr_stage1_subject.txt" file for all subjects is just filled with 0s.

Hi Roman,

Thank you so much for clearing it up. I really appreciate it. These details help us to better understand how these images are registered to each other. I think what you said makes a lot of sense. We just wanted to register the EPI image to T1 image in native space. Previously, we tried epi_reg a couple of times, but it did not work. After that, Paul suggested using flirt for registration. So far, flirt can register EPI image to T1 image. But, it's very confused about why epi_reg does not work. We are still working on it, we will keep you posted.

Anyway, any comments will be appreciated. Thanks.

Best,
Cain


Hi Paul,

Thanks for your suggestions. Our aim is to register the EPI to T1 image in each individual, and then identify the brain regions active during a given task. We are not going to do the group comparison and statistic analysis. So, that's why we first wanted to try epi_reg for registration. But, as you know, epi_reg seems not working, so we tried flirt function based on your suggestions.

I heard epi_reg is a very robust tool for registration. It should not have any issues for simple registration between two images. As you said, there might be something wrong during registration, resulting in BBR cost function being thrown off. Maybe it's because the skull is too bright? But, I am not sure. But, it's an interesting question.

Thanks,
Cain


Hi Paul,

Thanks again for your suggestions. The original resolution of the EPI image is 0.8*0.8*0.8, and the original resolution of the T1 image is 0.5*0.5*0.5. But, after applying 'flirt' function, I found the EPI registered to the T1 image became 0.5*0.5*0.5, instead of 0.8*0.8*0.8. Do you have any thoughts on performing registration, while keeping the original resolution of EPI?

Thanks. I am looking forward to your reply.

Best,
Cain


Hi Paul,

Thanks for your reply. I think it might be not related to the ghosting artifact in the T1 image, as I tried another subject without any artifact in the T1 image. And then I found the registration process had the same issue. I uploaded the images of another subject to https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rN_1Y33ZPcTup176n3ttfRgbOIQq6zHV?usp=sharing.

These images represent the ones reoriented by fslreorient2std function.
T1_reo.nii.gz
T1_mask_reo.nii.gz
EPI_reo.nii.gz

epi_reg_d.nii.gz represents the EPI image registered to the T1 image. Even though I tested with a new subject, the registration is worse. Do you have any further thoughts on this issue? Thank you so much for your suggestions.

Cain

Hi Cain,

I think the BBR cost function (which uses white matter boundaries to drive the registration) is being thrown off by the strong ghosting artifact in the T1 (there is a nose in the occipital region). 

For this data set, I think you may be better off using FLIRT directly with the default cost function, e.g.:

flirt -in EPI_reo.nii.gz -ref T1_reo.nii.gz -omat epi_to_t1.mat -out epi_to_t1.nii.gz

Hi Paul,



I uploaded the images that you mentioned a couple of days ago. I am not sure whether you are able to download the images that I uploaded. If you are not able to access these files, please let me know. Thanks. Do you have any thoughts on this registration issue? I am looking forward to your suggestions. Thanks.

Best,

Cain

Hi Paul,

Yes, sure. No problem. Even though I have not received any link to a onedrive folder, I created a link to share these files. Please download it via https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rN_1Y33ZPcTup176n3ttfRgbOIQq6zHV?usp=sharing .

I enclosed the original images without reorientation, including
T1.nii.gz
T1_mask.nii.gz
EPI.nii.gz

I also uploaded reorientated images derived from fslreorient2std, including
T1_reo.nii.gz
T1_mask_reo.nii.gz
EPI_reo.nii.gz

If you have any questions or any files from my side, please let me know.

Hi Cain,

I can't assess the registration quality from those screenshots. Are you able to share all of the image files used in that command? You should have received a link to a onedrive folder where you can upload the files.

Hi Paul,

Thanks for your reply. Based on your suggestions, I first ran fslreorient2std for each input image, as follows:

fslreorient2std T1.nii.gz T1_reo.nii.gz
fslreorient2std T1_mask.nii.gz T1_mask_reo.nii.gz
fslreorient2std EPI.nii EPI_reo.nii

And then run the registration,

epi_reg \
--epi=EPI_reo.nii \
--t1=T1_reo.nii.gz \
--t1brain=T1_mask_reo.nii.gz \
--out=epi_reg_d

So, it results in an image called epi_reg_d.nii.gz, which is shown in https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CztMLtmBKmyTt7Q9jFw55ueZcudv52rJ/view?usp=sharing. So, we can see, it indeed improved, but the sagittal plane and horizontal plane are still bad. Do you have any further suggestions?

Thanks,
Cain
