Hi

I'm trying to run oxford_asl on a pASL perfusion image. While it completes the process without any error, the perfusion images in the 
structural space, and thus the standard space, are completely off coordinate-wise. The problem seem to be due to incorrect 
registration of the native space to the structural space. I was wondering if anyone have had a similar problem and a solution for it. 
Here is the command line output:

--------------------------------------------------

Thank you so much for your insights. I will try to apply the smoothing to the PV estimates and see if this helps. This is keeping me 
from progressing with the project, since accurate CBF measurements are necessary. 

Best wishes, 
Miguel Hernandez

Hi Andraws,

I'm not particularly familiar with the ASL GUI, but I think the Run button will only be enabled once you have entered all of the 
required information. There are a number of examples in the documentation at

Dear Matthew,

Thanks for the quick reply. I was going to try the commands you suggested, but a clean reinstall of 6.0.7.13 (i.e. uninstalling FSL, 
Ubuntu-20.04, and all 3rd party X-clients, followed by installing FSL with the https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/docs/#/install/windows 
instructions) seems to have fixed the issue (the output of "echo $DISPLAY" after reinstalling was indeed ":0"). All GUIs are working. 
I'm going to try this on the other PC (maybe a bug/error occurred during "update_fsl_release"? Although in the terminal everything 
seemed fine). In case the outputs of the commands you listed are still of your interest, here they are:

a) ls -la /tmp/.X11-unix
total 4
drwxrwxrwx  2 root     root       60 Oct  7 19:31 .
drwxrwxrwt 11 root     root     4096 Oct  7 19:37 ..
srwxrwxrwx  1 emiliano emiliano    0 Oct  7 19:31 X0

b) ls -la /tmp/.X11-unix/
total 4
drwxrwxrwx  2 root     root       60 Oct  7 19:31 .
drwxrwxrwt 11 root     root     4096 Oct  7 19:37 ..
srwxrwxrwx  1 emiliano emiliano    0 Oct  7 19:31 X0

Thank you!

Emiliano.

Dear Emiliano,
On one of the machines running 6.0.7.13, can you make sure no 3rd party X-client is running ( e.g Vcxsrc, Xming ) and in the WSL 
terminal run

echo $DISPLAY

If the output isn’t “:0”

then can you run

export DISPLAY=:0

and retry a GUI ( e.g. fsleyes )

next, can you let me know the output from the following commands:

ls -la /tmp/.X11-unix
ls -la /tmp/.X11-unix/

Kind Regards
Matthew

Dear all,

Some problems with FSLeyes have recently appeared on two Windows 11 PCs (WSL 2). Originally, both of them had FSL 6.0.7.10 (Ubuntu 
20.04) correctly installed and everything worked, including FSLeyes. Sadly, after some Windows updates the "Unable to access the X 
Display, is $DISPLAY set properly?" error appeared, even though I had VcXsrv running as always. I tried several things that I found 
on this email list, including updating to the 6.0.7.13 version, trying Xming, and using the built-in X/Wayland server in the newer 
versions (following the instructions of https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa-jisc.exe?A2=FSL;f002806.2407). I can't pinpoint which 
Windows update caused the problem (assuming this is what actually caused the problem) because I had not used FSL in some months. 
Oddly, I have access to two other Windows PCs (one with Windows 10 and the other with Windows 11) that have installed the FSL 6.0.4.5 
version and everything is working correctly, including FSLeyes (WSL 2 with Xming). I have tried removing the 6.0.7.13 version using 
the "rm -rf $FSLDIR" command and Ubuntu 20.04 with the "wsl --unregister Ubuntu-20.04" (in a PowerShell) command. Additionally, I 
tried installing the 6.0.4.6 version of FSL in an Ubuntu 18.04 terminal with the legacy fslinstaller.py, and everything works fine 
except FSLeyes (including glxgears and all other FSL GUIs). When I type FSLeyes in the terminal, nothing happens, not even an error 
is produced in the terminal. During the 6.0.4.6 installation, an error ocurred (log file attached). It seems as if the Python version 
is not recognized in pip, as it requests a version >3.8, so I installed the 3.8.1 python (and python3) version but the same error 
happens, including detecting that the system's Python version is 3.7.6 when that version was never installed (previous version before 
updating was 3.6.9). Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks,
Emiliano Rodríguez.

Hi Paul,

The ASL GUI is more stable now,

But the run command cannot be viewed at all on the GUI window.

Thanks ,

Hi Andraws,

 

A better option, which will allow you to use asl_gui without the --matplotlib option,  is to run this command:

 

export GDK_BACKEND=x11

Hi Andraws,

A better option, which will allow you to use asl_gui without the --matplotlib option,  is to run this command:

export GDK_BACKEND=x11

Then you should be able to run "asl_gui". If this works for you, then you can make the change permanent by running this command, 
which will add it to your shell profile:

echo -e "\nexport GDK_BACKEND=x11\n" >> ~/.profile

Regarding the ZeroDivisionError issue, I suspect that you are trying to load a 3D image, where the ASL GUI needs to be provided with 
a 4D image.

Hi,

After running the codes and writing asl_gui in the terminal , the GUI doesn’t run and the output is :

Hi,

If you include the --cnr_maps you will have the following benefits:
- eddy will produce an SNR and CNR map of your data (this will happen whether you run eddy_qc or not)
- In its single-subject pdf report QUAD will include images of this SNR and CNR map.
- In its group pdf report SQUAD will include a comparison of the average SNR and CNR across subjects. This is probably the most 
useful in large studies as it allows you to identify subjects that have a high noise level even after running eddy.

SQUAD will already contain a lot of other metrics that can be used to identify outlier subjects, so it is up to you whether it is 
worth rerunning eddy just to get this SNR/CNR information.

Best wishes,

Michiel
