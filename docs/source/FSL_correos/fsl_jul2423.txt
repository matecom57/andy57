Hello, 

We are attempting to perform a regression with multiple comparisons correction between two 4D volumes (data1 and data2) using palm. The command we are running currently is: 

palm -i data1.nii -i data2.nii -n 10 -npc 

This command outputs several files, including: palm_vox_npc_fisher_c1.nii palm_vox_npc_fisher_c2.nii palm_vox_npc_fisher_fwep_c1.nii   palm_vox_npc_fisher_fwep_c2.nii   palm_vox_npc_fisher_uncp_c1.nii  palm_vox_npc_fisher_uncp_c2.nii 

palm_vox_npc_fisher_c1.nii contains high values that are not likely to be alpha or p values. 
palm_vox_npc_fisher_c2.nii is blank. 
The other 4 files all appear to be masks of palm_vox_npc_fisher_c1.nii. 

Is this the correct command to perform regression on two modalities with multiple comparisons correction?

All the best,
Nick
Hi Paul,

I tried using VcXsrv with the same results as with Xming.

With MobaXterm, I got this error:

Hi Paul,

I am using Xming on Windows.

I was able to successfully install FSL v6.0.5.2 based on the instructions provided by Matthew, but I am still having the same issue with not being able to properly use FSLeyes as described before (e.g., the viewer settings is basically frozen).

However, with FSL v6.0.5.2, I am not getting the error messages (debugger warnings), and instead, whenever I quit FSLeyes, I get a "Segmentation fault".

Thank you for your assistance,
Jee Won

Hi Alex,

Your internet connection seems to be a little slow (2 minutes to download the 60MB mambaforge installer- based on that, I'd expect the total download (3GB) to take between one and two hours). If you have access to a faster connection (e.g. from your workplace), I'd suggest trying the installation there.

There is a chance that this is simply due to an unreliable internet connection. But there is also a chance that mamba is mis-behaviing. Could you try re-running the installer ilke so?

export MAMBA_NO_LOW_SPEED_LIMIT=1
[python] fslinstaller.py [other options]

Paul

Yes, but transforming mc data back to generate uncorrected data is generally not a good idea as you will interpolate, so this data is not going to match the real uncorrected data.

Cheers,

Andreas

Betreff: Re: [FSL] MCFLIRT "transformation parameters"

 

Hi Amir,

 

You should be able to reconstruct an affine transformation from the motion parameters - this should be fairly straightforward to do in Python or MATLAB. Note that FLIRT matrices use a "scaled mm" coordinate system, so if you are using FLIRT to resample your data, you will need to ensure that the transformations are defined in terms of this coordinate system. You can read more about this at the following pages:

Hi Paul,

Thanks for your reply. I am using preprocessed data with no access to .mat files. I have a naive thought, please correct me if I am wrong: what if I apply the negated .par file on the motion-corrected scan to bring it to the previous uncorrected stage? Since those 6 parameters are rotations and translations (in radian and mm) wrt the images center of mass, applied to the original image to motion correct.

Hi Nelson,

FA should end up to be close to 0 for CSF. So the cyst itself should not affect the skeleton. But: there may be registration issues if you include the subject in a group analysis.
Looks like a Galassi type 1 or 2 cyst (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7089853/).

    Hope you are well. I am doing a TBSS analysis and there is something I need to check with you.
   
    I have a participant to whom we have found an arachnoid cyst close to the temporal lobe, causing mass effect (attached). The cyst is included as brain tissue in the mask and this is not corrected by registration. How will this affect the subject's FA skeleton, i.e., what is the value that the software is going to attribute to the part of the FA skeleton the “represents” the temporal lobe?

Hi, all!
 
I would like to check if there is a relationship of resting state patterns and antidepressant response, but as a continuum (i.e. exploring the "gradation of symptoms severity"), without separating people into responder and non-responder groups? I believe I cannot use FSL dual regression for that as I would need to divide them per group. Please, what would be the best approach for doing so? Maybe FSL FEAT (seed-based connectivity)?

Thank you!
Best,
Tamires

########################################################################

Hi Tamires,
  You can use any GLM design with dual_regression. If I understand your study correctly, you want to correlate a continuous variable ( severity ) with RSN-differences for a single cohort - in that case this design https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/GLM#Single-Group_Average_with_Additional_Covariate should work - you may want to modify the contrasts for your study ( e.g. drop the group-mean, test the opposite direction for the continuous covariate, and use a F-test to test for significance across those contrasts ).

Hope this helps,
Kind Regards

Hello,

 

I am new to using FSL and have been trying to use the relevant tools to preprocess diffusion data for DTI. Tools: topup, bet, eddy

 

My original data had 6 slices and I could not run topup on it as it kept producing inaccurate results. I opted to extract slices from the example data provided by FSL to first simulate the processing pipeline. Only after extracting 14 slices did topup work well for the slices in the middle (while giving cropped images in the peripherical slices).



 

This affected the binary brain extraction as well. So I only kept 10 slices in the middle and extracted the data. The brain region was extracted and a binary mask was generated succfully.

 

Now every time I try to run eddy it gives out unformatted text and keeps saying Terminating program which makes it difficult to figure out the underlying reason behind crashing.



 

I made sure that the dimensions of the input volume, the mask, and topup outputs are all the same (10 slices). May I know what could be the reason?

 

Best regards,

Ahmed Aburas

Hello,

I'm new to using the Probtrackx2 tool.
Reading the documentation, I understood that the -omatrix1 option outputs the vortex by vortex connectivity matrix (for surfaces) with a second coordinate file that lets us know the vortexes associated with each region (I'm working with 316 ROIs).
Then there's the -network option, which directly outputs the ROI by ROI matrix.

1- So, as I understand it, the -network option allows vortexes to be grouped into the regions to which they correspond, resulting in an ROI by ROI matrix. However, I've tried to get the ROI by ROI matrix using Matrix1 and the coordinates file, but I still can't, so can someone please explain the distinction?

The total for the network matrix ~= 40 million streamlines and for matrix1 ~= 214 million.

2- Concerning Matrix3, if I give the seed as a target, will I get the same result as Matrix1?

I really appreciate any help you can provide.

Hi Helka,

The error message is saying that the files you have specified in list.txt cannot be found, so the paths are incorrect. What happens when you run this command?

My filtered_func_data_clean files are not normalized in the MNI152 standard. Do you think this is a problem?
This is not the cause of the present issue, but it will be a problem for you - when running group ICA you need to make sure that all of the input data is anatomically aligned, so you will need to transform the cleaned functional data for all of your subjects into standard space. Assuming that you have already registered each subject using e.g. the MELODIC gui, an example of transforming your data is given in the "(Optional) Scripting" section near the bottom of the FSL course practical: https://open.win.ox.ac.uk/pages/fslcourse/practicals/ica/

Hi Udo,

Something is causing a corrupted version of PyObjC to be loaded, which is strange, as FSLeyes doesn't depend on that library. Could you run this command, and send me the resulting "trace.txt" file?

$FSLDIR/bin/python -m trace --trace --module fsleyes.main > trace.txt

Could you also double check which version of FSLeyes you are running by running these commands?

which fsleyes
fsleyes -V

After FSLeyes crashes, type "bt" into the (lldb) prompt and press enter
Send me all of the output
If you don't have lldb installed, you could install it into your FSL installation with the following command:

$FSLDIR/bin/mamba install -p $FSLDIR lldb

And then perform step 1 above with "$FSLDIR/bin/lldb $FSLDIR/bin/python -- -m fsleyes.main"

Hi Marvin

 

1) If you use the GUI in MultipleMasks mode, what is going on under the hood is that each mask will be used as a seed and the other masks as waypoint masks with the “OR” option.

2) You can’t easily add all the masks as terminations, as that would also include the seed mask, and streamlines will stop immediately. The easiest way to do this is to run probtrackx2 separately for each seed and use the other masks as waypoint/termination.

Hello all, 



I am hiring a postdoctoral fellow. Please see the description below and contact me for more details/questions. 



Description: The Adise lab in the Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism, Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Los Angeles, University of Southern California seeks a postdoctoral fellow to work on NIH funded studies investigating neurocognitive development of obesity and appetite regulation during childhood and adolescence. The start date for this position will be as early as 1 Sept 2023 but is flexible.

 

This research combines multimodal techniques including behavioral, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and biological markers of metabolic health. The postdoctoral fellow will be using Big Data methods to analyze large-scale questions in the ABCD Study geared at understanding how social determinants of health may influence neurocognitive development of obesity risk. There will also be opportunities to be involved in smaller scale studies at CHLA. Additionally, the candidate will work alongside leaders of the field of ingestive behavior, neuroimaging, and neurocognitive development.

 

Minimum qualifications/Work experience: Candidates should have a PhD in a relevant discipline (e.g., psychology, neuroscience, computer science, engineering, nutrition). A background in one or more of the following is essential: obesity/eating behavior, nutrition, biostatistics, big data analytics, neuroimaging.  Programming experience (Python, R etc.) will be highly valuable but is not absolutely required as a prerequisite (however, learning to program is an absolute must). Strong data analysis and writing skills required. 

 

If interested, please send a CV, statement of research interests, one or more PDFs of representative publications, and contact details of two references to sadise@chla.usc.edu

I've recently processed around 1000 T1w scans with fsl_anat (default settings), most of which go through just fine. However, fsl_anat is not producing a complete set of outputs for a subset of the scans. These failing scans do not exhibit any obvious quality issues. The processing seems to go haywire early, with the FOV cropping by robustfov; the "T1" output on these failing images all have inferior portions of the brain cropped (whether fsl_anat reports an error varies, but one error that sometimes occurs is an inability to segment the brainstem during the FIRST step).

Most of the images that are processed successfully were collected with k-space parallel imaging, but the ones that fail were all collected with image domain PI. I suspect that the image domain PI might be throwing off the heuristics used by robustfov by causing many of the background voxels to have an intensity that is far from the intensity of the brain voxels (most voxels in the background are exactly 0 whereas brain voxels have an intensity of around 10k). When calling robustfov alone, the slice along the z-axis that is reported as the top of the brain is far from the skull.

So, a couple of questions
- Does that (lots of 0-intensity background voxels) sound like a plausible source of the issue?
- If so, is there a recommended way to configure fsl_anat to handle these kinds of images?

It seems like there are several ways in which we can get things to work (e.g., skip cropping, do the cropping ourselves, replace the 0 intensity voxels with some helpfully random value, etc), but also it would be nice to process these images without giving them special treatment.

Let me know if it would be useful to see pictures or samples.

Thanks!

Hi Amir,

If you use the -mats option to mcflirt, it will save a FLIRT transformation matrix for every volume - you can invert this and transform each voxel back to uncorrected space.

Hi,

As a continue to this question, is it possible to use .par parameters to return the motion-corrected scan to its uncorrected form? Using flirt or any other tools?

Best,
Amir

The Institute for Human Neuroscience at Boys Town National Research Hospital in Omaha, NE, USA invites applications for three open Laboratory Director positions in Cognitive Neuroscience. For these junior faculty positions (Assistant Professor/Research Scientist I), we welcome applications from any area of cognitive neuroscience, including executive function, visual attention, perception, motor control, emotion, memory, and methods-oriented areas, and are especially interested in building our existing research programs in pediatric and adult brain health. Methodological specialty within neuroimaging is open, but ideally the candidate would benefit from our strong existing programs in multimodal MRI, MEG imaging, optically-pumped magnetometry (OPM), and/or neuromodulation, and develop a nationally recognized program focusing on their area of interest. The successful applicant will receive strong financial support for building their research program, including a generous start-up package, and would join a growing group of cognitive neuroscientists, both within the Institute and across campus, using the latest tools in human neuroscience.

 

Successful candidates will have a PhD, MD, DPT/PhD or MD/PhD in neuroscience, psychology, physics, computer science, or related field, with postdoctoral training and an excellent publication record for their career stage. Candidates should also have a sustained record of research in high impact journals and demonstrated ability, or evidence of the potential, to generate extramural funding commensurate with their career stage. Applicants should have the ability and interest to teach graduate courses in cognitive neuroscience, and to mentor PhD students in our growing joint PhD program in Neuroscience with Creighton University.

 

The 15,000+ square foot Institute for Human Neuroscience is a vibrant research environment with state-of-the-art equipment and ample opportunities for training and trans-disciplinary collaboration. The Institute houses the latest equipment available in the field of noninvasive neuroimaging, including a 3T Siemens Prisma MRI system, two Neo MEG systems, which are the most advanced MEG units currently available, an NIH S10 supported OPM suite, a mock MRI scanner, and a high-performance computing space. The Institute’s resources also include state-of-the-art high-definition transcranial direct-current and alternating-current stimulation (HD-tDCS/tACS) equipment, and biomechanical equipment for quantifying human movement physiology (i.e., KINARM, Delsys EMG, Vicon motion capture, Bertec force treadmill). The Institute maintains a 2,500+ square foot clinic that is staffed by research dedicated physical therapists, and the most up-to-date therapeutic equipment for conducting clinical trials with children and adults with neurologic and/or orthopedic impairments. Lastly, the Institute is the home for the Center for Pediatric Brain Health, which is an NIH P20 Center of Biomedical Research Excellence. The Center for Pediatric Brain Health includes multiple research support mechanisms for junior faculty at Boys Town, including both pilot project funding (approx. $50k direct costs per year) and major research project funding (approx. $175k direct costs per year for 3-4 years).

 

We expect to hire two or three junior faculty through the current initiative, with a start date in 2024. Interested applicants should submit a letter detailing current research interests, a list of the applicant’s five most important publications, and a curriculum vitae to Dr. Tony Wilson (tony.wilson@boystown.org). Contact information for three references will be requested at a later time. Review of applications will begin September 22, 2023 and will continue until the position is filled. Individuals from diverse backgrounds are especially encouraged to apply.

Hello Kiriya!
    Can you confirm the version of FSL you are using ( more $FSLDIR/etc/fslversion ) and upload one of the problematic files to a download service ( e.g. Google Drive, Dropbox ) and let me know the link?

Kind Regards
Matthew

Hello!

I’m currently working on running the command “bet” on a series of nii.gz image files using a shell script. The images I’m trying to “bet" are fairly conventional T1w 3D MPRAGE images with 1mm isotropic resolution.  The command executes properly for some image files in the series but for others I get the following error, “input image not valid”.

I’ve tried running the command manually from the terminal (I’m using Ubuntu 18.04.5 on Windows 11) and I get the same error as I do when I ran the command in the script. I also tried running it using the FSL GUI window and I get the same error.

I can still view these “invalid" image files using FSLeyes and they don’t seem to have any labelling or orientation errors (i.e. the outputs of fslhd are similar between the invalid images, and ones that can be successfully "betted"). I can also run different FSL commands and they execute properly; however, “bet” doesn’t seem to be working.

Does anyone have any idea as to why these image files might be invalid or a way to solve the error?

Ultimately, I just want to register all of my MPRAGE images to the MNI152 standard image, and I am under the impression that it is best to run "bet" first.

Thanks in advance!

Kiriya
