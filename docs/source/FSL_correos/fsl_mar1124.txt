Hi,

FYI, I used 3dresample to convert the template file into the same size as my ICA results. Then I run fslcc and it works. 

3dresample -master melodic_IC.nii.gz -prefix rsn20_resample -input rsn20.nii.gz 

Thank you for your attention.

Hi experts,

I have got the results of ICA from Melodic. The size of melodic_IC is:

dim1 54
dim2 64
dim3 50
dim4 20
pixdim1 3.000000
pixdim2 3.000000
pixdim3 3.000000
pixdim4 2.398998
Data Axes Orientation:
  first  (x) = Right-to-Left
  second (y) = Anterior-to-Posterior
  third  (z) = Inferior-to-Superior

Since I used Talairach templates for registration in preprocessing, the melodic_IC’s Template Space is TLRC. The  rsn20.nii.gz (download from https://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/datasets/brainmap+rsns/) is in MNI space. Do I have to convert my results to MNI? Or convert rsn20.nii.gz to TLRC?

The size of the rsn20.nii.gz is :
dim1 91
dim2 109
dim3 91
dim4 20
pixdim1 2.000000
pixdim2 2.000000
pixdim3 2.000000
pixdim4 1.000000
Data Axes Orientation:
  first  (x) = Right-to-Left
  second (y) = Posterior-to-Anterior

  third  (z) = Inferior-to-Superior

I searched the emails and tried to use flirt to uniform the size of both files. I tried following commands:

flirt -in melodic_IC.nii.gz -ref rsn20trlc.nii -out melodic_IC_align
flirt -in rsn20trlc.nii -ref melodic_IC.nii.gz -out melodic_IC_align
flirt -in melodic_IC.nii.gz -ref rsn20.nii.gz -out melodic_IC_align

But all of them only convert the first volume. The brain was also distorted, as shown in the following figure.

My questions are:
1) Dose fslcc have to have two inputs the exactly same size? Including voxels and axes orientation? 
2) Do the two inputs of fslcc have to be in the same space? Can I convert the Melodic_IC directly? Or do I need to redo the preprocessing into MNI from the very beginning?

Hello,

I recently installed FSL 6.0.7.7 on Rocky Linux 8. My .bash_profile is set as:

# FSL Setup
FSLDIR=/usr/local/software/fsl
PATH=${FSLDIR}/share/fsl/bin:${PATH}
export FSLDIR PATH
. ${FSLDIR}/etc/fslconf/fsl.sh

When I attempt to run the "Feat" command, it says the command is not found. I noticed that the soft links for Feat and others are only located in $FSLDIR/bin. Why are these soft links not also located in $FSLDIR/share/fsl/bin? Should I also add $FSLDIR/bin to the PATH in order to use these soft links?

Thanks,
Eddie

Dear FSL experts,
I am using featquery to examine %BOLD signal change and to extract peristimulus data. My input to featquery (tfMRI.feat) has 332 timepoints.

When examining featquery outputs, I found that mean_mask_ts.txt and tsplotc_zstat1.txt (data averaged over all voxels in all sig. clusters for contrast 1) both have 332 timepoints, but ps_tsplotc_zstat1_ev1.txt (model fits averaged over multiple stimulus repeats) has 483 rows. I am not sure why there’s discrepancies in timepoints. 

I look into the FEAT user guide and see that ps_tsplotc_zstat1_ev1.txt is encoded as peristimulus timing (i.e., time relative to the start time within the peristimulus window). What does this mean?

Thank you very much in advance.

Using fslvbm—on step “C” create the template—segments and makes files that appear to use the template.

 

ie

_struc_GM_to_T_init_warp.msf

_struct_GM_to_T.mat

_struc_GM_to_T.nii.gz

 

But—there is no “template_GM_4D” image—and no error message.

 

Help?

Hi Roman,

I can't quite tell from the screenshot, but it looks like you have interpolation enabled, which will cause smoothing across voxels.

Subject: [FSL] fsleyes: incorrect gray level
 
Dear Paul,
Dear FSL developers,

I noticed that fsleyes sometimes does not show gray (perhaps color in general) correctly.
Loaded is a NIFTI file with two time points in it. Volume=0 is T1W image, volume=1 is a mask of only 0s and 1s. As you can see on the image, pixel brightness at crosshairs is gray despite value reads 1 and should be white (max of brightness range).

Does this mean that T1W image from volume=0 somehow bleeds through?

Thank you,

Hi Paul,

I have updated my z.profile but it still does not seem to be working, below is my list of contents in my z.profile and what happens when i do echo $PATH in my terminal. Is there any indication of what I need to modify?

Hi James,

Are you using a Linux system? At the moment, MMORF can only be used on Linux, and cannot be used on macOS, as Apple do not support CUDA.

Paul

Hi - I am trying to compile and run MMORF. I have FSL 6.0.7.4 installed.

When trying to set it up, I get this error:

$FSLDIR/bin/conda create -c conda-forge  -p ~/gcc8 "gxx_linux-64=8.*" make

Collecting package metadata (current_repodata.json): done
Solving environment: unsuccessful attempt using repodata from current_repodata.json, retrying with next repodata source.
Collecting package metadata (repodata.json): done
Solving environment: failed

PackagesNotFoundError: The following packages are not available from current channels:

  - gxx_linux-64=8


Can you advise on how to set this up please?

Best wishes

Dear fsl experts, I hope you may be able to help me with this problem I am facing with eddy

When I try to run eddy I get the following error:
EddyInputError:  --imain and --mask images must have the same dimensions
Terminating program

Inspecting the mask and the main image I get the following:
fslinfo topup/*_mask.nii.gz
data_type       INT16
dim1            100
dim2            100
dim3            60
dim4            1
datatype        4
pixdim1         2.200000
pixdim2         2.200000
pixdim3         2.200000
pixdim4         1.000000
cal_max         1.000000
cal_min         0.000000
file_type       NIFTI-1+


fslinfo *_dwi.nii.gz
data_type       UINT16
dim1            100
dim2            100
dim3            72
dim4            129
datatype        512
pixdim1         2.200000
pixdim2         2.200000
pixdim3         2.200000
pixdim4         5.000000
cal_max         0.000000
cal_min         0.000000
file_type       NIFTI-1+

As you can see this is not merely a rounding error, the dimensionality of the two sets of images are different. Is there a way around this?
