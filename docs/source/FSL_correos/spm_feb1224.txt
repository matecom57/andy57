Hi Keng-Yu Lin,

I have seen similar issues arising here from time to time, but I don't have a good workaround or fix at hand. For me, the issue seems to be related to MATLABs web/HTML engine (maybe in combination with the Java Virtual Machine version used by MATLAB or other programs). Sometimes it helps to remove cached MATLAB data from the .matlab/R2018a/HtmlPanel, but this solution does not always work.

Best,

Volkmar

I've been using SPM in PET mode but it's still not working. Can anyone advise what I should do?

Dear all, we are trying to do group comparisons in SPM12 in three groups (2 types of dementia and healthy controls). However, in the 2ndLvl analysis with ANOVA or Full Factorial design the values of the covariates (age and sex) change after model estimation. Also the values of the groups in the model (which were '1'), change to a value around 1 and become greyish. I never ran into this issue with structural analyses (VBM). Is this normal in SPM or should we change some settings in our settings? Thank you!

We have a vacancy for a PhD student in our Alzheimer Nederland (Dutch Alzheimer Society) project

A 3-year fully funded PhD studentship is available at Aston University, United Kingdom to investigate the link between neurovascular ageing and early age-related decline in mobility and cognition.
The project will study healthy older adults and samples from older individuals experiencing walking speed decline and subjective memory complaints. As part of your PhD, you will use cutting-edge brain and retina imaging techniques to characterise participants’ brain vascular profiles linked to their functional status. You will also investigate the correlation between inflammation markers present in blood and the vascular profile.



Expected starting date – October 2024


These studentships include a fee bursary to cover the Home fees rate, plus a maintenance allowance. The allowance for 2024/5 is yet to be announced, but it is expected to be around £19,000. Up to £17750 of research and training support will also be provided over the period of the project.

Qualifications from overseas institutions will be also considered but performance must be equivalent to that described above, and the University reserves the right to ascertain this equivalence according to its own criteria. For financial reasons, this studentship is only available to Home students.

Applications should be made to the Aston Graduate School [https://lnkd.in/ezZqRzZz].

On the initial application portal:
- Select the College of Health and Life Sciences,
- October Entry,
- Full-Time attendance,
- Postgraduate Research.
- Under degree programme select Research in Health Sciences.

When asked to provide a project proposal, please indicate the title of the project and the name of the supervisor as listed above. Then detail how your knowledge and experience will benefit the project accompanied by a brief review of relevant research literature.

The Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences of the University of Coimbra Portugal (FPCE-UC) invites applications from rising and enthusiastic researchers in Cognitive Science and Cognitive Neuroscience for 3 Post-Doctoral positions to work with Alfonso Caramazza and Jorge Almeida.

These positions are part of a transformative ERA Chair grant CogBooster from the European Union to FPCE-UC led by Alfonso Caramazza. The goal of CogBooster is to implement a strong and international line of research in Basic Cognitive Science and Cognitive Neuroscience to contribute to the ongoing renewal of the Psychological Sciences in Portugal over the next decade.

 

Positions:

As part of this expansion and renewal, we are searching for Post-doctoral applicants with expertise related to the following areas:

·         1 Post-doctoral position in any of the following areas: lexical processing, visual object recognition, reading, or action recognition.

 

·         1 Post-doctoral position on visual object recognition, in particular on how object knowledge is organized and represented neurally and cognitively, using fMRI (potentially with ultra-high field MRI), and potentially ECoG/sEEG.

 

·         1 Post-doctoral position on object dimensionality and dimensional mapping, using population receptive field analysis/connective field modeling to work on topics related to the following preprint: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.11.29.568856v1

 

The selected applicants will work directly with Alfonso Caramazza and Jorge Almeida. They will be based in Coimbra, but will have the opportunity to spend some time at Harvard University, at Alfonso Caramazza’s laboratory.

Qualifications:

Applicants should be recent graduates – the date in their PhD diploma should not be before October 2021 (i.e., no more than 3 years from the signing of the contract). They should also have their diploma recognized in Portugal at the time of the signing of the contract (diploma recognition could be requested here). The start date is negotiable (but should be no later than fall 2024).

The successful applicant should have a strong record of research for their career level, and meet, or show promise of meeting, the following qualifications:

·  Research potential through publications with impact in the field;

·  Proficiency in English, both written and spoken (speaking Portuguese is not necessary);

·  Good written and spoken communication skills;

 

Offer:

The positions do not involve formal teaching. They do involve, however, lab mentoring.

 

The salary is competitive for Portuguese standards – 1800 euro per month net value. According to Numbeo, 1800 euro in Coimbra correspond to a local purchasing power of about 3230 euro in Paris, 3520 pounds in London (UK), 2685 euro in Brussels, 2385 euro in Rome, 2890 euro in Munich, about 4750 USD in Los Angeles, Boston or Washington, 4830 CAD in Toronto, or 5940 AUD euro in Sydney.

The position will be for a maximum of 3 years, renewable every year.
