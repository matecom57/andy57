Dear Vadim,

in measured data, the origin is defined by the hardware and image reconstruction parameters of the measurement device. MR scanners usually set the origin to the center of the magnet. If you position the head of your subject in a standard head coil and position this coil correctly in the scanner, images should actually be quite close to what MNI/Talairach define as origin.
If it is not absolutely necessary, I would not mess around with this. Unless your data are really far off the origin, SPM does a pretty good job moving your data to the correct location during spatial normalisation or segmentation.

Best regards.

Hi everyone,

I am reaching out due to a curious problem with DCM to seek any insights you might offer. Our analysis involves a comprehensive first-level full model that includes 10 regions of interest (ROIs). To streamline the model's complexity, we strategically reduced the connections from an the initial pool of 10x10 = 100 down to 57. (This reduction was based on the posterior probability (>0.95) obtained by inverting the A matrix in a preparatory step for the actual analysis.)

Consequently, in the single-subject full models, we set these 57 connections as active (value of 1), while the remaining connections were inactivated / pruned (value of 0) in our A and B matrices.

Following Zeidman et al. 2019, we then ran BMA+PEB on the inverted single subject model for both, the A and the B matrix. The results from the B matrix's PEB model appeared sensible and only included those 57 connections. However, the A matrix presented an unexpected outcome: 21 connections, which were previously pruned and set to 0 in the original single-subject DCMs, were part of the A matrix PEB model. I'm confused why PEB would have different parameters for A and B matrices because it is done on the same single-subject models. If I understand correctly, it should only calculate the Bayesian averages of those parameters.

I double checked the specifications etc. and I am not sure whether something has gone wrong. I would greatly appreciate any input, advice, or suggestions. Thank you very much in advance for your time.

Best,
Sabrina

Hi Luna

DCM.U.idx is used by the “specify group”  batch GUI when replicating a template DCM over subjects. It allows the GUI to know which experimental conditions to import from the subjects’ SPMs. The first column in DCM.U.idx is the condition number (within the Matlab structure SPM.Sess.U in your SPM.mat), and the second column is the regressor number (1 for the main regressor, 2 for the first parametric regressor, 3 for the second parametric regressor etc).

 

It will only have an impact on your results if you are using the “specify group” batch to generate your subject-specific DCMs from a template. Is that the case here?

Subject: RE: [SPM] What is the DCM.U.idx parameter for?

 

Hi Peter,

Thank you!

Initially, I thought I understood the logic behind the numbers in the DCM.U.idx generated by the DCM GUI. The matrix looked like this:

DCM.U.idx=[1 1

                    2 1

                    3 1

                    4 1]

 

I interpreted it as follows: the first column ranging from 1 to 4 corresponds to the four experimental conditions, and the second column consists entirely of ones.

 

Based on this understanding, I defined all DCMs in my code using the same idx matrix.  Namely, I applied this matrix to DCM.U.idx in all subjects' DCM files.

 

However, I later discovered that the DCM GUI generates the DCM.U.idx for another DCM (including parametric modulation regressors) in this format:

 

DCM.U.idx=[1 1

                    1 2

                    1 3

                    1 4]

This discrepancy has left me uncertain whether my approach of defining the same matrix for all subjects' DCM.U.idx was incorrect.

Would defining the DCM.U.idx matrix incorrectly in the code have a significant impact on the results?

Cheers, Luna

Hi Luna

This is nothing to worry about. If I remember correctly, I added that field to help with specifying DCMs using the batch editor. Its omission won’t alter your results.

Hi experts,

 

When checking DCM results, I found certain subjects' DCM fields include the parameter DCM.U.idx, while others don't. I suspect this variation might be due to different SPM versions used.

 

I'm wondering about the significance of DCM.U.idx. Can I combine subjects with and without this parameter in group analysis? Or should I consider redoing some DCM analyses?

Dear Zach

I hope you don’t mind me CC’ing the SPM mailing list so others can benefit.

 

You asked how to interpret the self-connections in SPM. In brief, writing out the DCM for fMRI neural model (ordinary differential equation) for a self-connection:

 

dz/dt = (-0.5 * exp[A + Bu(t)] ) * z + CU

 

Where u(t)>0 at times when the modulatory input is switched on and u(t)=0 at other times. Details of the terms of the equation are in the DCM tutorial paper (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.06.031) . Equivalently this can be written as:

 

dz/dt = (-0.5 * exp(A) * exp(Bu(t))) * z + Cu

 

So you can see the default connection strength is -0.5Hz, which is scaled by the exponential of the A matrix, and by the exponential of the B matrix (at times when modulation is switched on).

 

To answer your direct question, you are correct, and you can confirm this by plugging in numbers to the formula. E.g. if the modulatory input is on, so u(t)=1, and if A=0 and B=0, then the self-connection is -0.5 * exp(0) * exp(0) = -0.5Hz (the default value for a self-connection). If you increase the B parameter from zero to two, then it’s -0.5 * exp(0) * exp(2) = -3.7Hz, so much more inhibitory.

 

I hope that helps

Peter

 

Subject: Inquiry regarding interpretation of self-connection in one-state fMRI DCM

 

⚠ Caution: External sender

 

Dear Professor Zeidman,

 

I apologize for reaching out once again, but I've been grappling with the interpretation of self-connection in one-state DCM for quite some time.

 

There is the equation:



So, large 'a' parameter will cause faster neural decay than a small 'a' parameter.

 

For one-state fMRI DCM, the relationship between the values on the diagonal of matrix A and 'a' is:



So large values on the diagonal of matrix A (DCM.Ep.A) will cause slower decay than small values on the diagonal of matrix A. 

 

However, the values on the diagonal of matrix of B matrices are NOT log scaling parameters.

So larger values on the diagonal of matrix of B matrices (DCM.Ep.B) indicate the corresponding experimental effects faster decay than small values on the diagonal of matrix of B.

 

Am I correct?

 

Thank you!

 

Best,

Zach

I mean coregistering your images to the MNI template (Coregister/Estimate) so that their coordinate system doesn't have a big offset or some rotation with respect to MNI coordinates. Then in my opinion locations specified in this MNI-aligned native space will be similar enough to MNI coordinates for the purposes of EEG analysis. Also by default your results image for source reconstruction is generated in MNI template space no matter how your priors are specified.

 
Does this mean to transform my structural images to MNI using the "normalise write" function from SPM,
to build the head models and then do source reconstruction in this space? 

No, that's not what I mean.
 

About the epoching step, just to make sure: do you suggest separating my continuous signal into the periods of time of my conditions and then separating each condition into epochs of 1-2s like a sub epoching step ? 


I'm not sure how your conditions are recorded. If they are in separate files then you could just epoch each one into 1 sec epochs and then merge the resulting files. Otherwise you could convert each epoch separately (by specifying a time window) and then epoch it and merge. The most straightforward way to do this kind of custom epoching is write your own function for specifying the trl and conditionlabels variables that the epoching function takes as the input. But if you want to only use the GUI, you could do as suggested above.

Best,

Vladimir

Dear all,
I was wondering if there is a state of the art procedure for subjects with no parametric modulation.
One subject has same ratings for one contrast (therefore no modulation).
Should the contrast be excluded, or can we add some slight modulation..
Or are there some polynomial expansion that can deal with such cases?
Thanks

Dear SPM experts,

We used the default CMM_NMDA model in SPM12 to model the first 50ms of a TMS-evoked response registered with EEG. With PEB we then tested which (if any) parameter of the model was related to an external variable. 
I have issues interpreting the effect we see on the GABAa parameter as I do not fully understand what information it is conveying in the model:
Is GABAa mediating all the inhibitory connections allowed in the model (thus both the inhibitory feedback loops and the projections from the inhibitory interneuron to the other subpopulations)? 
Is it mediating just the inhibitory connections from the inhibitory interneuron to the other subpopulations?
Or is it conveying another type of information?

Thank you a lot in advance for your time and help.

Best,
Ilenia

Dear Vladmir,

thank you for your answer.

I managed to plot multiple topographies (for con images) modifying the SPM function "spm12/toolbox/MEEGtools/spm_eeg_img2maps.m". In case it might be useful to others, I attach the modified function here, and an example script for plotting 16 topographies at specified time points, customizing colormap, style and scale.

Regarding the t-maps, I saw that in other thread you had recommended not to use the function spm_eeg_img2maps.m because of biased outputs: https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=spm;b735448.1202.. Is this still the case? If yes, I found this very nice and easy to use toolbox to plot t-maps. Again, I attach the links in case they may be useful to others: (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12021-019-09447-6#Sec24) and scripts:https://github.com/JeremyATaylor/Porthole

Porthole and Stormcloud: Tools for Visualisation of Spatiotemporal M/EEG Statistics - Neuroinformatics
Electro- and magneto-encephalography are functional neuroimaging modalities characterised by their ability to quantify dynamic spatiotemporal activity within the brain. However, the visualisation techniques used to illustrate these effects are currently limited to single- or multi-channel time series plots, topographic scalp maps and orthographic cross-sections of the spatiotemporal data structure. Whilst these methods each have their own strength and weaknesses, they are only able to show a subset of the data and are suboptimal at articulating one or both of the space-time components.Here, we propose Porthole and Stormcloud, a set of data visualisation tools which can automatically generate context appropriate graphics for both print and screen with the following graphical capabilities: Animated two-dimensional scalp maps with dynamic timeline annotation and optional user interaction; Three-dimensional construction of discrete clusters within sparse spatiotemporal volumes, rendered with ‘cloud-like’ appe

MEEG Tools > `Plot Scalp maps from M/EEG image` and input my contrast image but I can't adjust the scale (nor select multiple time points, but this is less of a problem)

The function has an option S.clim that you can use to adjust the scale. You would need to run it from a script to specify that.
 
 for T maps,  I opened the SPM.mat in Results and saved the thresholded image. I tried to open it with MEEG Tools > `Plot Scalp maps from M/EEG image` again but it didn't work. I then tried to collapse the thresholded t image in time using `Images > Collapse time` (input: original spmT-map) and then tried to input the output image in MEEG Tools > `Plot Scalp maps from M/EEG image` (selecting time 1 1) but it doesn't work...



I'm not sure what you mean by 'didn't work'. If you send your error message I might be able to say more.

Hi everyone

Instats is incredibly pleased to be offering a 2-day workshop on Using ChatGPT and Copilot for Efficient Data Analysis in R, running March 20 - 21, by professor Peter Gruber (who holds dual PhDs in physics and economics). This workshop provides a 21st-century introduction to Statistical Analysis with R, focusing on the efficient use of AI assistants including ChatGPT and Github Copilot to automate R coding with plain language requests. Because R is free, this revolution will help democratize access to basic and advanced analysis tools without having to suffer the steep learning curve of coding in R. Participants will learn step by step how to install AI tools and how to harness their power for efficient data analysis in R, making them many times more efficient. They will be able to create R code in the blink of an eye and with unprecedented ease of use, while learning some of the underlying principles of the R language as this relates to competently assessing and using AI-generated code.

Register now and don't miss out on this unique opportunity to learn how to easily and rapidly code all of your analyses in R, and please feel free to tell your friends and colleagues!


Best wishes

1) Is it only possible to do DCM in MNI space since the prior source locations should be given in MNI coordinates or is it possible to conduct DCM analysis in native space for each specific subject ? 


I think this distinction is too fine to matter for DCM if you are doing it at the sensor level. So I'd just define source locations in MNI space and not worry too much about it. 

 
2) In source reconstruction I inverted a continuous signal, i.e., I did not separate the signal into epochs (trials). However I have a task which has 3 conditions in which I intend to study connectivity in each of them. Is there a way to separate my signal after source reconstruction so I can include them in the DCM model? 

Both source analysis and DCM were not intended to work on long continuous data segments. I'd suggest you epoch your data into arbitrary 1-2 sec epochs. There is a way to do it in the epoching tool. Then I would do both steps on these epoched data.

Vladimir

 

Thank you in advance.

Dear all,

Clicking on the "Origin" button in the display window brings the crosshair to a coordinate which is a so-called origin. What is this "origin" coordinate from the point of view of the scanning operator? What's the name of this original coordinate? Maybe  someone knows how to set its location in 7T SIEMENS MAGNETOM Terra. I am asking because for different subjects I get different origin locations. While the volumes can obviously be reoriented in SPM, a more straightforward way would be to fix in the location at the scanner side.

Thank you for the help.
