Hi all,

After merging my DTI images using fslmerge and overlaying on the MNI152 1mm template, some areas extend outside the standard brain. Despite applying a 0.2 threshold and the MNI152 brain mask, the issue persists.

Steps taken:

Registered images within FDT.
Thresholded DTI at 0.2.
Applied MNI152 T1 brain mask.
Visualized against the MNI152 1mm standard brain.

Any suggestions for a more precise masking to the standard brain boundaries?

Thanks!

Hello Yanina,
     Either approach could be used, but it may be simpler to run an individual second-level analysis per subject when it comes to adding the outputs to the final group-level analysis.

Hi Joey,
There are models where the “1's” approach can be used, but for the model here it would introduce rank-deficiency and should not be used.

Hi Matthew,

Thank you for your response!

Hi Nooshin,

I think that something has gone wrong in one of your intermediate steps. I would recommend repeating each step, and visualising the outputs after each step to figure out where things are going wrong.

Hi Anderson,

Thank you for the reply!

Just to make sure I understood:
1. I would want to run two different designs with the same nifti file, where one has 1s for both time points and the contrasts from design1 and will give me the time and interaction effect, and the other has 1s only for the "post" timepoint, and the contrast from design2?

2. makes sense, thank you

3. in my case, the time point between scans is relatively short, so that the age stays the same, so that both the age and the gender are fixed effects. The fear is that (a) just as you mentioned, the effect of the intervention is different in different ages. in that case, do I use the same number, (i.e. -34 and 34)? and (b) since we have a higher percentage of males in the control group, I want to make sure I am not measuring gender instead of my own effect. would I need to add two more columns? (-1 and 1 for male, pre and post and -1 and 1 for female pre and post)?

thanks again for all the help,
Ronnie

Hi Matthew,

Thank you for your response!

Dear Lin,

The hand_labels_noise.txt file should be saved at the same level as the filtered_func_data.ica folder, so in your case I think you should have 001/FIX_001.feat/hand_labels_noise.txt

 

Your call to re-train FIX should then work using

fix -t training_test1  001/FIX_001.feat 002/FIX_002.feat ….,

 

Hope it helps,

Ludovica

Yes, I downloaded it. 
After downloading the runtime, how should I set the path?

Right now my path is this: /Applications/MATLAB/MATLAB_Runtime/v96
However, when I run the compiler in the terminal, it says that it is not there.

Hello,
   For OSX you should be able run the pre-compiled binaries with the 2019a runtime ( see https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FIX/UserGuide for more details on MCR versions and download links ).

Hope this helps,
Kind regards
Matthew

Hi, Thank you so much for solving my previous problem.
The difference is, I'm trying to run FIX after running MELODIC.

I am using MATLAB version 2022b.

However, it says that I need to have a matlab compiler to run FIX, but when I try to run the .sh file in terminal,
I get this error : Can't find MATLAB compiled software for this OS.
What should I do?
My macbook version is Ventura 13.5.1.

Could you please tell me the order to run the m file in FIX-1.06.15 version, if I don't need a compiler to run FIX when using the paid version of MATLAB?

Your answer would be appreciated.
Thanks.

Dear Magundhu,
 An FSL install should usually complete within one to two hours. I would begin by listing the log file ( /tmp/fslinstaller_LfPHis.log ) to see what the last recorded message is, checking if the installer process is still active ( e.g. with top ) as well as running ls -alrt in the installation folder ( /usr/local/fsl ) to see when file-activity last took place.

Kind Regards
Matthew

Dear FSL Developers,

I am facing an installation issue. Though the installation shows 100% completion, there is still no finished or completed message. It has been in the same position for a long time. When I checked the size of the FSL, it was around 9.7 GB. 
Should I wait or cancel it?

Please suggest. 

Thanks in advance
Magundhu
