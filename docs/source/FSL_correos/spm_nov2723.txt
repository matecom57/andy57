I'm not sure what was involved in FSL's coregistration, but if it did any image reslicing of the fMRI, maybe take a look at the time courses of these data to see where the effect has been introduced.

What sort of interpolation did you use?  Have you looked at the fMRI as a movie (e.g., using the Browse functionality in Check Reg).

Best regards,

Display the maps using Check Reg and then use the "SPM Figure" pulldown of the Graphics window. Select Colours->Effects->Invert.  This will invert the colour scale.

Hello experts,

When conducting fMRI DCM analysis, the A matrix serves to establish intrinsic connections. However, in the context of ERP DCM, this definition doesn't apply as intrinsic connections specifically denote self-connections.

When reporting results in ERP DCM, what term should we use for the connections in the A matrix? The manual suggests that the A matrix represents the connection strength parameters for the initial evoked response.

Could we refer to it as the baseline connectivity? For instance, can we state that 'The values in the A matrix reflect the baseline connectivity?’

I'm a beginner, so I apologize if my question is silly.
Cheers,
Luna

Dear prof. Zeidman,

I am working on a DCM analysis and have several questions regarding the set-up which I would love to hear your thoughts on.

A quick description of my data: I have two sessions where participants were presented in the scanner with one task and one control task. In session 2, we see an increased brain response in mainly one area and a bit in another area with a general GLM. To investigate further, I did a PPI analysis. I made a contrast of the task and control task of [1 -1] and from there exported the VOIs for my seed region (the one region where I saw the most brain activity increases). I did this separately for the first and the second session. I saw that there was effective connectivity between my seed region in session 1 with three other areas (one of which was the area that I also found in the general GLM). However, in session 2, there was no effective connectivity between my seed region and any other regions.

This led to my hypothesis that, in session 1, there might be more effective connectivity between brain regions, and that after our intervention, in session 2, there is a more localized system, where there is more effective connectivity of an area with itself instead of with other areas so to say.

For my DCM, I used a simple model of the two brain areas that popped up with my general GLM, leading to four model options. I did this for session 1 and session 2 separately, but am now thinking that it might be better to concatenate those sessions in the GLM set-up and then use them as modulators so that there is a direct comparison in the results between sessions 1 and 2. Do you think this makes sense? And does it then make sense to have the modulator effect on all possible connections? 

The other question is regarding my tasks. I have the task and the control task and am interested in the effective connectivity during the task. Do I take the task as a modulator as well in my model, also on all possible connections? Should I then leave the control condition out of it or also use it as a modulator in my model? 

As you can read, I find it hard to determine the set-up regarding modulators. I have read several papers now on the topic but can't seem to find a paper that has a similar setup as mine. I am really looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this.

Thank you very much in advance.

Best,
Sophie

Dear SPM experts,
I am new to SPM and trying to coregister fmri images (rest images, 200 volumes) to T1 images and then perform normalization to the MNI space.
Coregistration has been performed with FSL and normalization with SPM and both of them work very well.
But after performing normalization with SPM, i tried to visualize the timecourse of mean intensity of 3 different brain regions. We noticed the presence of several spikes at regular intervals, not present before, not in the original database and not even after FSL normalization.

I can t explain their presence, if they are caused from some artifact, and how to remove them.

Any help or explanation would be greatly appreciated!

Dear Christian

I am still struggling with my model. 

I have just realized that entering age in my model as you suggested I'm correcting my other covariate (cognitive scores - CVindex below) for age and not correcting my cortical thickness values for the effects of age.

My main purpose is to check whether neurodevelopment related changes in cortical thickness are correlated with the cognitive scores, but I'm afraid that there are alterations in cortical thickness related to age that I would like to exclude (control). How can I do that? 

Is this correct?

How can I correct my model for the effects of age on thickness?

JOB OPENING: PhD position
Where: Cognitive Control & Habit Lab, CINC-CSIC, Alcalá de Henares Madrid, Spain
When: early 2024
Title: The role of habitual inhibition in cognitive and emotional control (PID2022-136996NB-I00)

Dr. David Perry (https://perrylab.ucsf.edu/) is now inviting applications for a NIH-funded postdoctoral fellowship position in his lab at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Memory and Aging Center. The goal of our lab’s research is to elucidate brain-behavior relationships in neurodegenerative disease in order to improve diagnostic certainty and identify therapeutic targets.

 

The UCSF Memory and Aging Center (memory.ucsf.edu) is part of the Department of Neurology and Weill Institute for Neurosciences. It has an extensive research infrastructure, with over 250 full-time research faculty and staff. The postdoctoral fellow will have the opportunity to participate in our innovative, interdisciplinary research environment. We are looking for candidates who have a background in neuroimaging, strong statistical training, and programming experience. The start date is flexible; review of applications is ongoing. Applicants should send a brief cover letter describing interests and relevant prior experience, CV, and contact information for three references to ([log in to unmask]). 

 

The postdoctoral fellow will work on our lab's study investigating abnormalities in reward processing in neurodegenerative diseases and mood disorders. Reward processing involves a determination of what an individual will work for or pursue, such as food, money, or social approval. Patients with neurodegenerative and mood disorders have profound changes in their reward valuation. We propose that a greater understanding of reward-seeking behavior in these illnesses and their underlying neural mechanisms will improve diagnostic accuracy and lead to therapeutic targets for behavioral symptoms that currently have no adequate treatment. Our studies of reward processing use behavioral paradigms with tools such as psychophysiology, as well as structural and functional neuroimaging.

Dear Réka

I would like to work out why you are experiencing this problem. I have tested both the stable release version of SPM from our website (https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/download/), and the latest development version from Github (https://github.com/spm/spm), and I’ve not yet managed to reproduce the issue (using Matlab 2021a on Windows).

 

Please could I ask you to do the following, to install a clean version of SPM:

 

Close MATLAB.
Download and unzip SPM from whichever of the two sources above that you prefer.
Open MATLAB. Click Set Path on the toolbar at the top, and remove any entries from the list related to SPM or its subfolders.
Still in the Set Path window, click “Add Folder”, and select the top-level directory of the SPM you downloaded (there is no need to add subfolders).
 

Then type spm fmri and press enter, click the large Dynamic Causal Modelling button, then click Specify.

 

If the problem still persists, please could you tell me what version of SPM you downloaded, which version of Matlab you’re using, and which operating system?

My question is about the procedure after clicking the "3D Source Reconstruction" button and running "Invert".

I want to do the 3D source reconstruction for the entire data from 0 to 60 seconds instead of specifying a time window.
Should I input [0 60000] in the "Time window(s) (ms)" field after clicking the "Window" button to do this?
This data would be weighted by the Gaussian, but is it not necessary to process whole data for 60 seconds with the same weight? Considering PST Hanning has already attenuated the beginning and end of the data in the Invert stage, I believe it is unnecessary to attenuate them again with the Gaussian.

Dear Sam

This is a good question – one that I’ve been thinking about recently. I hope you don’t mind me CC’ing the SPM mailing list, so others can benefit. There are surprisingly many ways to model a 2x2 factorial design using DCM for fMRI, and the best approach isn’t always obvious. This can be resolved by trying different options and performing Bayesian model comparison, to see which option maximizes the free energy for your dataset. Your question was as follows (responses inline in black):

 

I read one of your posts in the SPM mailing list in which you suggest two ways to model a 2x2 factorial design.

 

Option 1: Drive the network with only level 1 of factor A (A1_B1 and A1_B2), leaving the other level unmodelled. Modulate particular connections using factor B, e.g. by computing an input vector (parametric regressor) which is the simple main effect of A1_B1-A1_B2.

 

Option 2:  Drive the network by all four conditions (these could be combined into a single ‘Task’ input to capture the mean of the experimental conditions). Modulate particular connections either by the individual conditions, or contrasts of them. For example, the main effect of factor A: (A1_B1+A1_B2)-(A2_B1+ A2_B2) and the main effect of factor B: (A1_B1+A2_B1)-(A1_B2+A2_B2).

 

Let's say I have factor A and B, each with two levels (so A1_B1, A1_B2, A2_B1 and A2_B2), and I hypothesize an interaction - a connection from region A to region B should be boosted by B1 only in the A1 condition.

For option 1, this is how I constructed my 1st level GLM:

Dear Luna,

I can call it 'the imaging option' or 'distributed sources'. See https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811909004285

Hi Ben,

As far as i know, the "distortion correction " option on the sequence card you mention refers to the correction for gradient non-linearities, which I believe corrects for rather small effects with modern gradients in brain MRI. This correction applies to any kind of images (eg, structural and functional).

Insread, the distortion correction you seem to be concerned about is the one for B0 inhomogeneities, particularly important for all EPI-based MRI (eg functional, perfusion, and diffusion). To correct this, you need a B0 field map, which you can acquire from a field map sequence directly or derive it from two short EPI acquisitions with opposite phase-encoding directions of the protocol you are using

Dear all,

We are setting up a new Siemens Vida with a 64-channel headcoil using a multiband sequence. We established most configurations with the help of Siemens engineers and ran some initial tests. For one configuration we are however not sure. The sequence includes “Distortion correction” and we are not sure of whether to switch it on or off. (1) If we set to OFF  gre_fielmap would be acquired and used for offline distortion correction, or would it make sense to (2) set it to ON and benefit from the correction, or (3) set it to ON and include the additional offline field correction? A general concern is whether the online distortion correction may lead to changes in the brain shape or signal that may later reduce the sensitivity for analyzing changes related to neural processing.

Many thanks in advance and best wishes,

Dear Jasmin,

If you disable the serial orthogonalisation, SPM will leave the parametric modulator untouched - it will not orthogonalise it with respect to the main effect (the onset regressor as you call it), i.e. it will not mean-centre it. You can verify this visually by looking at the time series with Review > Design > Explore > Session s > Condition.

Hi everyone,

 

I have a model with one onset regressor and one corresponding parametric regressor. For the sake of some control analysis, I want the parametric regressor to NOT be orthogonal to the onset regressor. Is it enough to set the orthogonalization (.orth) to 0 in my batch script and enter the parametric regressor without mean-centering it? Or does .orth only affect serial orthogonalization between multiple parametric regressors and does not affect cases where only one parametric regressor is entered? In this case, how would I proceed?

 

Thanks a lot for your help!

Jasmin

Dear Jasmine,



If you have an image image.nii and a mask mask.nii you can compute the mean and stdev of that image within the mask with:



spm_summarise('image.nii','mask.nii',@(x) [mean(x) std(x)])



Best regards,

Guillaume.

Thank you very much! I have been able to create masks for the grey and white matter and have applied them to the bias corrected image. 
I have used the command spm_summarise on these images but I can't find the mean voxel intensity and the standard deviation. If anyone could point me to where these values are, that would be great. 

Thank you,
Jasmine

Hi Jasmine

Just pick a number close to 1 c1, c2 etc are posterior probability maps. If you want your mask to contain voxels where the probability of being GM is above 99% you should choose 0.99 as the threshold, another (more intuitive, but less correct) interpretation would be that least 99% of the voxel contains gray matter.

Hi Guillaume,

Thank you for the help. For the first step, how would you define the thresholds to be used in ImCalc?

Thanks,

Dear Jasmine,
There is more than one way to do this but what you could do is first create binary masks of grey and white matter from the c1/c2 images obtained via segmentation (by thresholding using ImCalc) then compute the mean and stdev of your MR image within these two masks (using spm_summarise). If you need help with the implementation of these two steps, just let us know
Best regards,
Guillaume.

Hello,

Any help with this would be greatly appreciated.

I am trying to define thresholds for binarizing a mask, and I need the mean and the standard deviation of the voxel intensities in both grey and white matter (separately) for a normalized/bias corrected MRI image. I was told that these values are provided as a part of the segmentation algorithm, but I am unable to find them anywhere (in both Segment and Old Segment). I was thinking to compute the values using the probability maps, but those values are meaningless since the intensity is almost homogenously white. Am I missing something in the segmentation output or is there a way to calculate these values?

Thanks so much in advance,
Jasmine

Dear SPM experts,

I hope this email finds you well. I am currently working on a research project involving the use of the SPM software. I have a question regarding the Hemodynamic Response Function (HRF) function in the spm_hrf.m file.

I have gone through the code and I understand that there are seven parameters (p(1) to p(7)) involved in modeling the HRF. However, I would appreciate some clarification on the specific meanings of each parameter.

% Haemodynamic response function
% FORMAT [hrf,p] = spm_hrf(RT,p,T)
% RT   - scan repeat time
% p    - parameters of the response function (two Gamma functions)
%
%                                                           defaults
%                                                          {seconds}
%        p(1) - delay of response (relative to onset)          6
%        p(2) - delay of undershoot (relative to onset)       16
%        p(3) - dispersion of response                         1
%        p(4) - dispersion of undershoot                       1
%        p(5) - ratio of response to undershoot                6
%        p(6) - onset {seconds}                                0
%        p(7) - length of kernel {seconds}                    32
%
% T    - microtime resolution [Default: 16]
%
% hrf  - haemodynamic response function
% p    - parameters of the response function


I am particularly interested in understanding the mathematical or physiological significance of each parameter and how they interact to define the HRF.
Best regards,
Xiangnan Tian

Dear Xinyu,
SPM provides the statistic of the combination of regressors being > 0

If you want to check whether

-1 1 0 0 > 0 0 -1 1

 Is equivalent to check

 (-1 1 0 0) - (0 0 -1 1) > 0

which leads to contrast

-1 1 1 -1 > 0

Hope this helps
Carles

Dear SPM experts,

I am trying to set up an analysis for subjects divided in two groups (between-subject factor) , each was measured two times (within-subject factor). After reading tutorials I realize that I should use flexible factorial design to test the interaction effect.
In CAT12 manual, it says that to test the interaction effect:

For Time 1 > Time 2 & Group A > Group B (interaction)
1 -1 -1 1

But in my study, what I want is to test whether there is a larger increase in an intervention group compared to a control group (i.e., time 1 < time 2 and Group A > Group B if I understand it correctly).
I am a bit confused how to modify this to achieve my goal. Should it be [-1 1 1 -1]? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you very much.
Xinyu

Hey everyone,



does someone know if SPM can be used to unwarp with a AP and PA Spin Echo fieldmap and (if yes) where I can find a manual for that?



Thanks a bunch!
