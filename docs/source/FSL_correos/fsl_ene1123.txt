Hi Will,


Great to hear that you took some time off for a holiday!

 

I will email you a link to a OneDrive folder with some sample data and our basis set.


Thank you so much for all your help, we really appreciate your support and your work to build FSL-MRS.

 

Best,

Erin

Hi Erin,

 

Sorry for the long delay in replying, I took some time off before Christmas for a holiday and have just returned to the lab.

 

Thank you for checking those couple of things. I’m sure we can make some tweaks to the fitting code to improve this. Would you be able to send us an example of your data and basis set so we can test against it making any changes?

Dear Will and Saad,

Happy New Year!

We are continuing to find that FSL-MRS is imparting a significant first order phase when fitting our data (>20 deg/ppm).

In response to your previous questions:

1. There is not a first order phase on the basis set. This is a basis set for semi-LASER that was simulated with FID-A and converted with the makebasis function in LCModel, all with pretty well default settings. Attached is the output of basis_tools vis.

2. Yes, we have removed the first point in the FID, though it doesn't change the appearance of the real part of the spectrum very much. I suspect that the deviation of the first point from a pure FID is related to some residual water that is out of phase, not to errors in the timing of the pulse sequence that would lead to a first order phase effect.

It would be great if we could place a limit on how much first order phase could be allowed on the basis set.

Please let me know if you need any further info.

Thank you so much for your help,
Erin

Hi all,

I ran into this error while running a 2nd level analysis (averaging parameter estimates across runs for each participant):

This only comes up for cope3. Is there something amiss with my design.fsf file? How may I fix this? I will appreciate any leads on this. Thank you so much!

Hello FSL Users,

I came across an error when I used fslmaths in FSL version 6.0.4 to multiply one value of a mask (voxel values that equal 2) by some free water metrics. It works fine for most of my nifti images except for files where the background space in the image is set to 1, while the images that work have the background value set to 0. In the below example, the “problem file” is FW_f.nii.gz
fslmaths ./mask.nii.gz -thr 2 -uthr 2 -mul ./FW_f.nii.gz ./mask_FW_f.nii.gz

Then that command generates the message:
./script_name.sh: line 35: 33768 Segmentation fault

That context being given, I have the following questions:
1. I’m wondering if FSL version 6.0.4 has some sort of expectation that the background of an image should be equal to 0 instead of 1, and if that could raise a “Segmentation fault” warning? (Interestingly, the segmentation appears to still run, but I am not sure how accurate it is given the “Segmentation fault” message.)

2. If this is the case, is there an fslmaths or other FSL command where I can either change all of the voxels that equal 1 to 0, or subtract the value of 1 from all voxels that are equal to 1 in the image while keeping all other values constant?

I searched the archives and could not find a question that matched what I am experiencing.

Thank you,
M

Hi,

A user of mine is still using 5.0.10.  We are seeing that part of their preprocessing stage is suddenly taking 12-14 hours which used to take less than 1, and I'm baffled as to why, as nothing I'm aware of on the machine has changed; I'd love if anyone has any ideas. I don't even really understand what it is spending all this time DOING. 

The process:

/cm/shared/fsl-5.0.10/bin/melodic -i filtered_func_data -o filtered_func_data.ica -v --nobet --bgthreshold=1 --tr=1.500000 -d 0 --mmthresh=0.5 --report --guireport=../../report.html


Here are the files it has open:

Hi,
    Similarly to the other thread, the best place to start is by checking the logs subfolders ( in both the .gfeat and cope3.feat folders ) to see if there are more detailed error messages.
