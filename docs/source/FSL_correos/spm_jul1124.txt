Join Our Dynamic Research Team!

The Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine at the Hong Kong 
Polytechnic University invites applications for postdoctoral scholars. We 
are dedicated to pioneering research at the forefront of brain imaging and 
genetics, leveraging AI technology to analyse large datasets and uncover 
insights into brain development in early life.

Over the years, our lab has spearheaded numerous human studies focused on 
brain health and cognition in children. With a repository of brain scans, 
cognitive assessments, genetic profiles, and environmental data from over 
60,000 subjects across multiple time points, we are committed to 
unravelling the complexities of developmental conditions.
