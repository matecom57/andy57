Hello,

We are upgrading our MRI Lab servers and workstations to Rocky Linux 8. We have used ext4 for the past 10 years, however we are considering using XFS for its better performance with larger files and parallel processing. I'm curious to hear which file systems other FSL users use.

Thanks,
Eddie


Dear Sven,
  That should be fine - it‚Äôs just a small text file.

Kind Regards
Matthew

We have an exciting opportunity for a motivated postdoc to join the Learning, Memory, and Decision Lab at UCL in London (https://lmdlab.github.io/), within the Max Planck UCL Centre for Computational Psychiatry & Ageing Research.

Expertise in neuroimaging of memory *or* decision-making is desirable.
For brief information, see ex-Twitter:  https://x.com/gelliott_wimmer/status/1717562876368408820 (or bluesky: @elliottwimmer.bsky.social)

The aim of the project is to better understand the role of memory, mood, and mood disorders in goal-directed decision-making.  The position is funded by the UK MRC for behavioral and neuroimaging research in the area of memory and goal-directed decision making.  The postdoc would be designing and conducting neuroimaging experiments investigating the role of memory reactivation and replay using multivariate neuroimaging approaches to MEG data.

Using a transdiagnostic approach, the fellow can also investigate the influence of mood as well as depression and anxiety on learning & decision-making.  We investigate these questions using large-scale online experiments and in-lab behavioral studies.

Informal inquiries are welcome.  Prior to submitting an application, please submit a current CV including publication list and a brief statement describing your experience and interests to Dr Elliott Wimmer (e.wimmer@ucl.ac.uk).

Review is rolling, but the current deadline is January 2nd!

Hi,

You probably need to install gradunwarp. As mentioned on the UK biobank pipeline README (https://git.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/falmagro/UK_biobank_pipeline_v_1), you can install that using one of the provided installation scripts. You should be able to find those in the following directory:
 /home/fs0/pry648/scratch/Biobank/bb_python/python_installation

Best wishes,

Michiel

Hi,

I can't tell anything from those screenshots - can you share one with the statistic image overlaid on top of the MNI152?

Paul

Hi,

The statistic images are masked according to the functional data, which may be slightly different to the MNI152 brain mask. Do the thresholded results look sensible?

Paul

Hi Phoenix,
   That should be enough to pass the checks - are the inputs ‚Äúlower-level feat directories‚Äù or ‚Äú3D cope images from feat directories‚Äù ( and if the second are the inputs in the <blah>.feat/stats folder )?

Kind Regards
Matthew

Dear FSL experts,

I was analysing resting state networks extracted by group ICA. And I'd like to compare the network activity of three repeated sessions using the design matrix for Repeated measures ANOVA on https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/Randomise/UserGuide#Repeated_measures_ANOVA. However, I'd also like to control for age and IQ. After I added age and IQ -- demeaned -- as two nuisance variables in the matrix, it showed the warning that "at least one EV is (close to) a linear combination of the others." I have checked the design matrix that age and IQ (demeaned) were not correlated with each other. I wonder if that warning would influence my results greatly.

Thank you for your help in advance!

Best wishes
Yan

Hi Dianne,

Thanks - that's an as yet unresolved issue with the math/latex formatter. We don't have a fixed date for the transition to the new documentation (and the URL is going to change), so I'd recommend sticking with the wiki for the time being.

Hi,

 

Yes, that helps a lot! I will do that üòä

Hi Annelies,
                   For a general contrast you will need to manually combine the EVs ( in the python script ) to form the effective EV corresponding to each contrast - so assuming a [1 -1] contrast for "Encoding Experimental vs Encoding Control‚Äù the effective EV would be EV1-EV3.

Hope this helps
Kind Regards
Matthew

Dear All,

 

I‚Äôm currently recruiting for a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroimaging (FMRIB), at Oxford. The post aims to develop new encoding methods and sequences for functional magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (fMRSI) in the human brain. Experience of spectroscopy is not a requirement. The post details are attached, and in the official job posting. Feel free to get in touch for more details by replying to this email, and please pass it on to anyone you think might be interested.

Hi Sven,

Can you share the contents of the log files that are contained in the <analysi.feat>/logs/ directory?

Paul

Hi Austin,

Have you checked inside the stats/ sub-directory?

Paul

TICA is not running on my computer (MacBook M1, FSL 6.0.7.5)

any help is highly appreciated

Hi FSL,

I am currently on tbss_2_reg step of the TBSS analysis and our team was wondering if we should use both timepoints (baseline, endpoint) for the -n option (option is to align every FA image to every other one, identify the "most representative" one, and use this as the target image).

Hope to hear back soon!

Best,
Ryu
