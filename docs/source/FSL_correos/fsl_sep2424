Hi Matthew,

well, this is odd:

- the output from set | grep FSL when i open up a terminal on the local 
machine is the same as when logging in remotely

- i can ssh into the machine from my laptop next to me (as well as from 
home) and the command-line tools work

- i can also ssh into the machine locally (navel-gazing?) and all is 
working...

i shall check with our local sysadmin to see if they know what's going on!

many thanks for your help,
cheers,
Nick

Hi Nick,

Can you compare the output of running "set" in both local/remote 
scenarios, without restricting yourself to FSL-specific environment 
variables?

Hi Aidana,

You shouldn't need to install an X server to use FSL on Windows 11. Can 
you describe what was happening when you tried to run FSL/FSLeyes without 
an X server?

Paul


Hi Paul,

thanks for the feedback. Just to check we're on the same page. When you 
say running FSLeyes over VNC - you also mean running FSLeyes within a 
remote desktop session that is accessed via VNC. As that is what we are 
using here. We access a remote desktop through VNC and in that desktop 
open FSLeyes.

FSLeyes works fine with this setup on one server, but not on the other. So 
my suspicion is that it has to do with the way fsl is installed and access 
to libraries on that one server (which unfortunately is where I have to 
install FSL as a module, but otherwise don't have access to server 
management).

Hello,

 

It seems that there is a mismatch between the Masterfile and the columns 
you provide to the options.

 

If your Masterfile has:

FLAIR_mask  T1 WMH_ROI FLAIR_to_MNI.mat

 

then

--labelfeaturenum=2 should be 3 (pointing to the WMH labels)

And
--featuresubset=1,3 should be 1,2 (FLAIR and T1)

 

Also, although probably not the cause of the error,

--patchsizes=39 is likely too big. If you want 3 and 9 as patches you need 
a comma.

 

Hope it helps,

Ludovica

Hi Tanja,

 

As you pointed out, the exclusion mask provided does not include the 
caudate, which is why you still get false positives there. The initial 
reason for not including it is because with some FLAIR sequences, the 
caudate is not so hyperintense and masking it out was causing false 
negatives close to the ventricles (periventricular caps). In your case it 
seems that the caudate is brighter and causes misclassifications so you 
can mask it out in addition to the default mask.

 

Adjusting the threshold is also likely useful. I have seen some 
fluctuation in thresholds across datasets, with lower thresholds usually 
more appropriate for datasets with high amount of WMH, which is in line 
with your case.

 

Hope it helps,

Ludovica

Dear Matthew,

Thank you for your email.

I have moved all the files into a new folder and re-run tbss_1, tbss_2 and 
tbss_3. I get the following error: (pasting below the slurm output)

(no error message up to here)

The issue is on creation of mean_FA image but I do not understand why or 
how to solve it.

Any advice is appreciated.

Hi,
I am a phd student just starting out and needed some help with my PALM 
analysis. I work with hdEEG data, and want to analyse connectivity changes 
at different time points - 5 different time points -  with respect to a 
baseline. Since I have Data from the same subjects, I want to perform a 
repeated measures anova. I am confused as to how to make the design matrix 
and if I should include the subject factors there or make an 
exchangeability matrix for it. Any leads on how to go about this would be 
greatly appreciated.
I also want to perform another comparison, because I have hdEEG data 
during sleep - in 3 different sleep stages, and during wakefulness. I also 
want to see if the change in connectivity across different time points 
differs between the sleep stages. The baseline Data is different for each 
sleep stage. I also have different subjects for each sleep stage (some are 
common).

I tried making a design matrix with one column for each group and 
including subject factors and contrast matrix where I compared each time 
point to the baseline, but the design matrix had some rank issues.

Any input would be appreciated.
Cheers,
Vismitha

Miguel,

 

In principle it would be possible to apply smoothing to the PV estimates 
that mimics the PSF of the ASL data, I imagine that would help. I am 
afraid this isnâ€™t something we have a ready solution for though.

Hi Mariana

 

I believe the skeleton is calculated once for the subject-average FA map. 
To visualise the between-subjects variability post-registration, you can 
look at the all_FA.nii.gz file in movie mode in FSLeyes.

 

Cheers

Dear Paul,

Yes, I was following instructions given on that website. I tried to run 
fsl without installing X server, but it wasn't working, however when I 
installed Xming fsl command worked, but fsleyes is not loading. I have 
Windows 11.

Thank you for your help!

Sincerely,
Aidana

Dear FSL experts,

In Keihaninejad et al. (2012)- PLoS, it is mentioned about skeletonisation 
the following "...a white matter skeleton is created, representing major 
tracts common across all subjects. A threshold of FA>0.2 is set to include 
the major white matter pathways, but to exclude peripheral tracts where 
there was significant inter-subject variability and/or partial volume 
effects with grey matter."

I want to investigate the overlap differences between multiple 
skeletonised images using the option tbss_3_postreg -T. Is there a Tbss 
output image that I can use to extract this information from please?

If not, can you please suggest how can I possibly get this information?

Regards,
Mariana
