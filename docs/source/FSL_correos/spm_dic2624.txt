Dear Peter,

 

thank you for that very helpful information about the SPM release which I really appreciated.
I have needed a little bit time to get clear which release I wanna use for my first research project.

I'm happy to looking forward for the week of the 6th January 2025 and will be use the actual version of SPM for my first 
research project and will start after that with the preprocessing steps (VBM and SHOOT toolbox and so on). Between the time 
today and the 6th January 2025 I will use the current development version to become familiar with the preprocessing steps 
in SPM. And of course I'm also happy to use the newest SPM software in future for my first research project.



If I will have any questions in future about SPM I will contact you and the SPM mailing list again.

 

Dear all,

when trying to estimate mean/volume inside ROI in cat 12 I recieve the following warning:



Save D:\MRT_Phobie\VPN\vbm\Expert_mode\statistik2\ROIfu_cobra_Vwm.csv.
Warning: Escaped character '\M' is not valid. See 'doc sprintf' for supported special characters.



The Excel files are written but do only contain the name of the ROIs...

Any help or suggestions?

Many thanks!

Cheers

Dear Torsten

The development version is simply the current working version of SPM that is under continuous development. It does not have 
the same level of testing as an official release. The next release (25.01) is scheduled for the week commencing 6th January 
2025 and if you need it sooner , there is a pre-release version available at 
https://github.com/spm/spm/releases/tag/25.01.rc3 .

 

For the tools you mentioned, I would indeed recommend either the development version or the pre-release of 25.01.

 

Best

Peter

Dear Felix,

the needed contrast is described here:
https://neuro-jena.github.io/cat12-help/#long_two
https://neuro-jena.github.io/cat12-help/#long_contrast

However, this contrast may artificially inflate your results and this longitudinal design is not really appropriate to test 
the main effect:
https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2019.00352

Furthermore, you can skip using TIV as covariate for long. designs since only individual changes in TIV would be considered 
(anything else is considered as subject effect). TIV should not change between the time points...

Dr. David Perry (https://perrylab.ucsf.edu/) is now inviting applications for a NIH-funded postdoctoral fellowship position 
in his lab at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Memory and Aging Center. The goal of our lab’s research is 
to elucidate brain-behavior relationships in neurodegenerative disease in order to improve diagnostic certainty and 
identify therapeutic targets.
 
The UCSF Memory and Aging Center (memory.ucsf.edu) is part of the Department of Neurology and Weill Institute for 
Neurosciences. It has an extensive research infrastructure, with over 250 full-time research faculty and staff. The 
postdoctoral fellow will have the opportunity to participate in our innovative, interdisciplinary research environment. We 
are looking for candidates who have a background in neuroimaging, strong statistical training, and programming experience. 
The start date is flexible; review of applications is ongoing. Applicants should send a brief cover letter describing 
interests and relevant prior experience, CV, and contact information for three references to ([log in to unmask]). 
 
The postdoctoral fellow will work on our lab's study investigating abnormalities in reward processing in neurodegenerative 
diseases and mood disorders. Reward processing involves a determination of what an individual will work for or pursue, such 
as food, money, or social approval. Patients with neurodegenerative and mood disorders have profound changes in their 
reward valuation. We propose that a greater understanding of reward-seeking behavior in these illnesses and their 
underlying neural mechanisms will improve diagnostic accuracy and lead to therapeutic targets for behavioral symptoms that 
currently have no adequate treatment. Our studies of reward processing use behavioral paradigms with tools such as 
psychophysiology, as well as structural and functional neuroimaging.
