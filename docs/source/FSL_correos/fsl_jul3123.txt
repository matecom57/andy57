Hello everyone, 

I am running eddy on cam_can data but is not even running and I got this error: 

Failed to open outlier report file camcan/sub-CC110037/dwi/dwi_preprocessed/04_eddy/sub-CC110037_dwi_denoised_eddy.eddy_outlier_report

Actually, these are not additional EVs; my research is about epileptic spikes, and I should consider every spike as a regressor, so if I have like 500 spikes in my data, I am going to create a GLM with 500 regressors that each of them has only one value (onset time in a text file) when I did that for all of my runs I am going to look at the average (second level analysis). I tried different ways to create my GLM in the first level analysis since adding them manually is time consuming and not possible, but I have not found a practical way yet.

Really appreciate your help,

Best,
Yusra

Sorry to take so long to reply.
There are not obvious things to tune in robustfov, but in the past it has done well on a wide range of images, however, it does make a few assumptions and it sounds like your image domain PI might be breaking them.  It is definitely possible that lost of exactly zero voxels could cause a problem, but it does depend on how they are distributed.  The main assumption that robustfov makes is that there is only noise above the head and not any strong artefacts or highly non-Gaussian distributions (though it should ignore the zeros).  It then determines the first slice containing head by the fact that the intensities associated with the head are a long way into the tail of the distribution.

So it is certainly possible that this is a problem but seeing some pictures would be helpful - both some axial slices and some sagittal and coronal slices.  You can’t attach things to emails on the list, so it is better to just provide a link to a place where you can host the pictures.

One workaround that might work (or not, as I can’t really tell without seeing the images) is just to add a very small amount of noise to the image, as that can often make robustfov happier, although it obviously slightly degrades the quality.  So you could just add noise to the problem ones, run robustfov on the noisy version, apply the same crop to the original (without noise added), and then feed this result into fsl_anat with the —nocrop option.  This would probably work for all of your images (assuming it works for these unusual cases).

So do send us some pictures and I’ll take a look.
All the best,
        Mark

Hi,

I've got a resting state dataset where each participant was scanned twice within the same session. I'm looking for a way to analyse this resting state data using both scans as one entry, so to speak, for that individual. I realise I can't use MELODIC for this, as the scans can't just be concatenated or entered as individual entries without causing issues wit the analysis. Is there a way to set FEAT up to analyse resting state? I've had a go, but I'm really not sure how the FILM model should look & I'm getting odd results due to this.
Thanks for any advice!
Rachel

Subject: [FSL] Nonlinear Registration
 
Dear Experts,

I am running MELODIC, and I would like to perform a nonlinear registration as part of the preprocessing pipeline. The name of the brain-extracted image file is '201_t1_brain.nii.gz'. In the same folder, I have the non-extracted whole brain image '201_t1.nii.gz'. However, when trying to perform MELODIC with nonlinear registration, the following message appears:

"Warning: Nonlinear registration is turned on, but FEAT cannot automatically find the whole-head image related to the selected brain-extracted structural image... If this is not changed, the nonlinear registration will use brain-extracted images instead of whole-head images; this is suboptimal." (for the whole message, see the attached image).

Can someone please help me resolve this issue?

Best wishes, Tom Eek


Hello,

No, it is for the first level analysis, that is why I have difficulty finding a way; I tried to add all my regressors into design .fsf file and then run it through Linux but it is not practical and then I should do the higher(second) level analysis for all runs across the subject.

Best,
Yusra

Hello Yusra,
   Is this for a higher-level analysis? If so then you can use the “Paste” Button to enter a full matrix ( make sure the “Number of EVs” is set correctly first ) into the GUI.

Hope this helps,

Is there any way not to create txt files manually and add them in FSL not using Gui? I can create my regressors using MATLAB, but I am not sure how could I use it through FSL. I used text2vest command to create design. mat file, but I do not know how to use it exactly. If you have a suggestion, I would really appreciate it if you could email me back.

Hi all,

I'm currently running command line Melodic on human connectome data (the preprocessed fMRI data comes as 2D CIFTI .dtseries why I can't use the MELODIC GUI). From what I understand the command line only performs ICA decomposition, not standard space co-registration. What would be the best way to perform this co-registration manually?

Best and thank you in advance,

Hi Zakaria,

Any output from probtrackX will only include the count of valid streamlines. If you want to get an ROIxROI matrix you should really be using the --network flag (https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FDT/UserGuide#ROI_by_ROI_connectivity_matrix), not --omatrix1.

Best wishes,

Michiel



Hello,

Thanks for the feedback.
Is there a way to filter matrix1 and have only a valid streamline matrix?

My goal was to use matrix1 to get an ROI by ROI matrix of all valid streamlines (using the coordinates file).
I tried to do this, but as you said, the total number of streamlines is much greater.

Best regards,

Hi Zakaria,

The total number of streamlines generated for --omatrix1 will be exactly Number of vertices (or voxels) * nsamples. However, not all of those streamlines will be valid (depending on the other flags you set in the probtrackx2 run), so the number of valid streamlines will indeed by <= number of vertices * nsampels. You can find this number of valid streamlines in the "waytotal" file. As noted before, the number you get when you sum --omatrix1 will be much higher (namely "number of valid streamlines" * "number of vertices hit on average by each valid streamline").

I think that for --sampvox any number between 0 and the typical distance between vertices would make sense.

Best wishes,

Michiel

Dr. David Perry (https://perrylab.ucsf.edu/) is now inviting applications for a NIH-funded postdoctoral fellowship position in his lab at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Memory and Aging Center. The goal of our lab’s research is to elucidate brain-behavior relationships in neurodegenerative disease in order to improve diagnostic certainty and identify therapeutic targets.

The UCSF Memory and Aging Center (memory.ucsf.edu) is part of the Department of Neurology and Weill Institute for Neurosciences. It has an extensive research infrastructure, with over 250 full-time research faculty and staff. The postdoctoral fellow will have the opportunity to participate in our innovative, interdisciplinary research environment. We are looking for candidates who have a background in neuroimaging, strong statistical training, and programming experience. The start date is flexible; review of applications is ongoing. Applicants should send a brief cover letter describing interests and relevant prior experience, CV, and contact information for three references to (david.perry@ucsf.edu).

The postdoctoral fellow will work on our lab's study investigating abnormalities in reward processing in neurodegenerative diseases and mood disorders. Reward processing involves a determination of what an individual will work for or pursue, such as food, money, or social approval. Patients with neurodegenerative and mood disorders have profound changes in their reward valuation. We propose that a greater understanding of reward-seeking behavior in these illnesses and their underlying neural mechanisms will improve diagnostic accuracy and lead to therapeutic targets for behavioral symptoms that currently have no adequate treatment. Our studies of reward processing use behavioral paradigms with tools such as psychophysiology, as well as structural and functional neuroimaging.

Hello Michiel,

Thanks for your help, I now understand the differences better. I was about to spend much time trying to figure this out.

I think the best option for what I want is --omatrix1.
In this case, the total number of streamlines will be <= Number of vertices * nsamples, right?

One last question, what do you recommend for the --sampvox option when using surfaces as seeds? (For volumes, I've tried the radius of the sphere enclosed by the voxel).

Thanks a lot,
Zakaria

Another potential cause of the issue is available RAM - it looks like a call to FAST was killed, which usually means that it ran out of memory. Would you be able to follow the instructions in this post, to make sure that your WSL system has enough RAM:

Hi Alice,

Sorry, now I see you actually mentioned that conversion to rad/s in your original email.

I'm not clear on how you altered the epi_reg. You say you do not register to the structural, but you still use flirt with a BBR cost function. However, the BBR cost function requires a tissue segmentation (from FSL FAST), which you can really only get from the structural image. Perhaps, you can send the edited epi_reg script so that we can have a look.

Best wishes,

Michiel
