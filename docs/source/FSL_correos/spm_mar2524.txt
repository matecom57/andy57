Dear Vadim,

the best thing to do at the scanner side would be to check for consistent positioning of subjects on the scanner table and within the head coil and for consistent positioning of the subject within the magnet. Unless there is a manual override, subject placement within the scanner should be quite automated. As for subject placement in the head coil, a good rule of thumb is to have the lateral center markings of the head coil in between eyes and eyebrows of the subject.

Dear Volkmar,

Thank you for your detailed answer. My problem is that unless I set the origins in the center of the brain (somewhere around the AC), the segmentation & normalization is completely messed up. I attach EPIs of two subjects which have very different origins and I have no idea why this happened (two subjects were scanned one after another on the same day). In the left subject segmentation & normalization worked just fine. For the right subject, only after I reoriented the volumes by positioning the origins at the AC (similar to the left subject), the segmentation & normalization started to work. Obviously, the origins were the same throughout all volumes of the same subject, including the T1. So, I wondered whether something can be done at the scanner side...

Thank you,
Vadim

Dear Vadim,

in measured data, the origin is defined by the hardware and image reconstruction parameters of the measurement device. MR scanners usually set the origin to the center of the magnet. If you position the head of your subject in a standard head coil and position this coil correctly in the scanner, images should actually be quite close to what MNI/Talairach define as origin.
If it is not absolutely necessary, I would not mess around with this. Unless your data are really far off the origin, SPM does a pretty good job moving your data to the correct location during spatial normalisation or segmentation.

Best regards.

Dear Carles, 

Thanks for your quick answer!
We tried with the code below but in this way we were not able to save anything, there was no output.  We tried also with normalise.write but in this way the output atlas wasn't in the right space, do you have any suggestions? 

Thank you very much, 
Best regards
Elena

Dear Vladimir,

right, sorry I meant thresholded t-maps.. That toolbox I shared last time, unfortunately, plots only peaks but not all the thresholded significant t-values.. Any chance you could share the codes you used in your Science 2011 paper (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21566197/) to plot thresholded t-maps at selected time-points?

Thanks again for your help and time,

Benedetta

-          2 Postdoctoral researchers (2 years each, starting late 2024 – early-mid 2025 preferred)

 

Project aim: To understand the relationship between individual-specific temporal structures of neural activity—particularly focusing on alpha-band neuronal oscillations—and variability in perceptual and cognitive functions.
Specific segments of the project will explore temporal structures of neural activity linked to inter-individual variability in contextual effects in perception.

 

Project methods: The project involves the collection of large-scale datasets comprising resting-state and event-related electroencephalography (EEG) data, recorded alongside behavioral performance in a wide range of visual tasks. The analysis will combine human psychophysics, EEG and EEG inverse modeling with advanced multivariate statistical and predictive modeling techniques.

 

PhD position (starting as of 2024):

Main tasks:

1.     Recruitment of study participants, collection, and analysis of EEG+behavioral data.

2.     Dissemination of research through conference presentations and peer-reviewed publications.

Requirements and ideal skills:

-         Master’s degree in Cognitive Psychology / Neuroscience / Bioengineering / Physiology.

-         Strong motivation and commitment to data collection and analysis.

-         Previous experience with psychophysics and EEG/signal processing (a plus, not mandatory).

 

Postdoc positions (starting late 2024 – early-mid 2025 preferred):

Main tasks:

1.     Analysis and modeling of EEG+behavioral data.

2.     Leading sub-projects (from experimental design to data analysis).

3.     Development and validation of codes and toolboxes for public release (Matlab, Python, R).

4.     Dissemination of research through conference presentations and peer-reviewed publications.

Requirements and ideal skills:

-          Proficiency in neuroimaging techniques (EEG, inverse solution) and signal processing (ERP, spectral analysis), as well as psychophysics.

-          Good/strong statistical, computational, and programming skills.

 

The project involves collaboration with a broad network of partners both within and outside Switzerland.

Dear SPM Experts,

Is it okay to extract beta values of sig clusters/regions using MarsBaR, defined using spherical masks with a radius of 8mm around the peak coordinates? I have seen many earlier papers extracting beta values using spherical masks around peak coordinates too, but a reviewer commented that a sphere centered at the peak coordinate is not representative of the whole cluster, and that I should use the whole SPM clusters in their original form instead... could you please kindly advise if  the latter approach is the better one please?





Many thanks,



Lena



Hi Elena
you can use deformation tools:
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.defs.comp{1}.def = {LDEFORM_FILE};
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.defs.out{1}.pull.fnames = {FULLPATH_ATLASFILENAME};
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.defs.out{1}.pull.savedir.saveusr = {OUTFOLDER};
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.defs.out{1}.pull.interp = 0;
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.defs.out{1}.pull.mask = 1;
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.defs.out{1}.pull.fwhm = [0 0 0];

defining LDEFORM_FILE as the file containing subject's deformation from MNI to native. You can get this transformation by several ways, the most usual is to ask to store iy file in segmentation or using deformation tools to invert dartel's flow fields

Hope this helps

Two PhD Studentships in Deep Neural Networks for Medical Imaging

Brain development in infants and its disruption by preterm birth or perinatal injury, can be measured with functional MRI (fMRI). Unfortunately, infants move in the scanner and half the images are discarded, precluding clinical application. In recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) have led to breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and are finding growing application in biomedical imaging. DNNs have considerable potential to correct head motion in fMRI, as they can learn complex mappings, and exploit knowledge of brain structure. The PhD Candidates will develop DNNs to motion correct fMRI data.

Candidates must have expertise in at least one of the two following areas and must be willing to develop skills in the other:
design and optimisation of deep neural networks
neuroimaging
Candidates must have expertise in programming in python or another language.

The studentships comprise EU fees, stipend and conference travel.

Experienced Postdoctoral Fellow in Infant Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience​

The Foundations of Cognition project is studying the emergence of cognition in infants, and how this is disrupted by brain injury. It has acquired functional MRI in a substantial cohort of 2-and 9-month-old infants (N=134), awake watching pictures and movies. The postholder will work with Professor Cusack and the team to use this rich dataset to characterise infant’s emerging cognition: critically evaluating the literature, developing a hypothesis, implementing the analysis, interpreting the results, and writing the manuscripts(s).

Dear Peter,
Thank you for your quick reply!
And in your experience, does the exclusion of these subjects impact the model comparison result? For example: I assumed two alternative models to the full One, can the posterior probability of compared models increase and/or decrease as a result of excluding these subjects?

Dear Debora
I'm assuming the subjects with low explained variance had little or no activation in their SPM analyses (particularly in the region(s) that receive driving input).

You can either include the subjects with little or no activation - acknowledging that a representative sample of the population will include some people for whom experimental effects couldn't be detected - or you can exclude them, focussing your results on just those who do show activation. Both approaches have been used and can reasonably be justified.

All the best
Peter

Dear SPM and DCM experts,
I'm running a DCM analysis. While checking diagnostics I noticed the presence of some subjects with poor explained variance (less than 10%). After checking their single-subject First level SPM Maps, am I entitled to esclude these subjects from the 2nd level DCM analysis? Does the esclusion of these subjects affect the results obtained from the model comparison?
