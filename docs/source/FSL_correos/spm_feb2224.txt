Dear Marko,

I am not sure if this directly serves your needs, but in the context of
Random field theory-based p-values: A review of the SPM implementation 
(Section 4.1) we have implemented a simplified version of spm_est_smoothness.m  
that directly estimates spatial smoothness based on an MRI volume time series. 

However, in how far the (potential violation) of the standardized residual assumption 
influences the validity of this smoothness estimator, or how a (spatiotemporal?) Z-transform 
should be implemented rather than fitting a GLM, I unfortunately cannot say at this point.

Cheers,
Dirk

Gesendet: Mittwoch, 21. Februar 2024 08:10
An: SPM@JISCMAIL.AC.UK
Betreff: [SPM] Smoothness estimation
 
Dear All,

for an approach I am currently evaluating it would be good to have an
estimate of the inherent smoothness of the data under scrutiny. I am
aware of the implementation in SPM using spm_est_smoothness.m and how I
can extract a global FWHM from an estimated SPM.mat file, but I would
like to look at fMRI data that has not necessarily been analyzed yet.

I do find the help text in spm_est_smoothness.m intriguing ("Inputs are
a mask image and a number of standardized residual images, or any set of
mean zero, unit variance images") as I understand how the former
approach is implemented but am not quite sure how one could implement
the latter. So I wonder if anyone has come across a way to derive such
an estimate in Matlab from a simple fMRI timeseries using said latter
approach without setting up a statistical model first. If so, any hint
would be appreciated.

Thanks in advance
Marko

Dear experts,

 Thanks for this excellent tool,
 I am unsure about two things related to the tfce toolbox:
1) Which is the difference between the T_log_pFDR generated when running the TFCE tool, and the logP_t{contrastname}_pFDR5 image generated when transforming SPM maps to log p values? I guess the former is non-parametric T and the latter is parametric, but not sure. In any case, the results are not the same.
2) In the second case, when transforming SPM maps to logP_t{contrastname}_pFDR, if I want to calculate a unilateral contrast with 95% "confidence", should I go with the pFDR5 or pFDR10?

Thanks in advance

Dear Jochum,

what you observe is the effect of non-sphericity correction based on your error covariance settings. SPM uses weighted least squares to estimate the effect sizes, which means filtering both data and design by an estimated error covariance matrix. Small deviations from the input design are indeed to be expected. If the weighted design matrix is dramatically different from the specified one, you should look a the error covariance estimates.

You may use the "Review" button to bring up the design review GUI. Then you should look at "Design->Explore->Covariance structure". This will give you an overview of the estimated error covariance matrix and its components. As I wrote in a different reply recently, at model specification time think thoroughly about expected deviations from sphericity assumptions and only set "unequal" or "dependent" options when it is necessary.

Best,
Volkmar

Hi Batel Yifrah,

where does the "z_scored_image" struct come from? My guess would be that you reused image information from one of your input images, which is an "int16" image and has a different value range than your "z_scores" volume. spm_write_vol will discretize your float z-values to 16 bit integer precision which will require scaling of stored integer values to float values. See the help for "spm_vol" for details. When you prepare your "z_scored_image" struct before writing, you may want to set "z_scored_image.pinfo(1:2) = Inf;". This will override previous scaling information and force spm_write_vol to recalculate it based on your data.

Best,
Volkmar

Dear Luna,

there are two basic rules related to your analysis question:

First, you should always leave your time series intact. Removing parts of it will most likely disturb estimates of serial autocorrelation and confounding signal artefacts like low-frequency signal changes.

Second, you should model experimental variance, even for "tasks of no interest". If the control task is designed in a way that does not draw too much attention from the task of interest, it might be sufficient to just model "response" events irrespective of correctness. If you fear that correct or incorrect responses may have an impact on brain response to your task of interest, you may want to model separate events for correct and incorrect responses. However, if your control task is just a change of color of e.g. the fixation point and the subject misses to press a button once in a while, you should just model the correct responses and leave everything else as is. You don't need to look at the activation maps for these events except for quality checks - if your response is a button press, you should see motor activation in it. In addition, you may want to establish a cut off at which you exclude subjects completely from further analysis if their attention to the control task falls below a certain threshold.

Best,
Volkmar

Dear Jason,

"classical" task-related fMRI will not work well for blocks longer than 20-30 seconds for many reasons. Long blocks do not only make it difficult to dissociate task related signal components from confounds. They are also challenging in terms of subject behaviour. In task-related fMRI the subjects are expected to completely focus on a specific task activity throughout the entire duration of each block. While this will work quite well when performing e.g. fingertapping for 20 seconds, watching a video clip for 168 seconds will most likely not keep subjects attention focused.

If you want to use task-related fMRI methods to analyse your data, you may treat watching the video as baseline activity and model specific occurences of visual or auditory cues within the video as fMRI task events. Alternatively, it may be worth trying resting state analysis methods to analyse functional connectivity for each video presented.

Best,
Volkmar

Dear Michael,

To follow on Torben's response, I don't think the extreme weights at the end are necessarily anything of concern.  For a linear model with correlation V, the optimal whitening matrix, K = V^(-1/2) can have strange characteristics, but still be the 'right' answer.

Consider the simplest of all correlation structures, an AR(1), an order-1 autoregressive model...

T=100;
rho=0.9;
Q=spm_Q(rho,T);
imagesc(Q)    % a nice correlation matrix

... it is a very well-defined and well-behaved model...
image.png
and the whitening matrix itself doesn't seem weird

imagesc(inv(sqrtm(full(Q))))  % whitening matrix also seems OK

image.png

but look at what the intercept looks like whitened...

Int=ones(T,1);
plot(inv(sqrtm(full(Q)))*Int)  

image.png

... it gives much higher weights to the ends of the time series.  This is a result of edge effects of how, despite it being a stationary correlation structure, the beginning and end are necessarily different due to the lack of symmetry (i.e. no data before time 1, nothing after time 100).

Hope this helps!

Hello,

I am a postdoc in Tor Wager's laboratory, and we are investigating the effects of FAST on our fMRI BOLD data.

We believe that accounting for autocorrelation is important under such circumstances but were wondering if FAST is applied properly. We are concerned that the W matrices (whitening) produced by FAST produces extreme edge effects in the time-series data that do not look intended.

Attached is a figure illustrating the effect of W x g (session-level grand-mean scaling) on the time series data, summarized by the dot-product of a multi-voxel neural pattern of interest (Neural Pain signature). Notice that in the orange line, the beginning and the end of the data become extreme relative to the original data. Run-3 also exhibits a very strange oscillatory pattern that was not present in the original data.

Can someone help us shed light on this issue? Thank you very much.

What we usually do is running the most relevant t-tests at the 2nd level

 

But to test a specific hypothesis, at the 2nd level, we would use these weights with a t-test to test that C shows higher activation (or the opposite weights if your hypothesis is that C should show less activation) than the other conditions:

 

A   B   C  D

-1 -1 +3 -1

 

Hope this is useful.

Onderwerp: [SPM] Contrasting 3 conditions simultaneously

 

Dear experts,

I am a PhD student working with Dr. Begoña Díaz. We have conducted a task-based fMRI experiment with 4 different conditions. We suspect that 3 of these conditions (e.g., A, B, and D) might not be eliciting significantly different activity from each other and that therefore we could potentially model them as being the same.
I was wondering how I could test if these three conditions are actually not eliciting significantly different activity from each other. I'm trying to avoid having to do 6 t-tests if this is in any way possible.

The solution I've come up with is to conduct a between-conditions F-contrast at the first level as follows:
A B C D
-1 1 0 0
0 -1 0 1


And conducting a one-sample T-test of these first-level contrasts at the second level. 


I was wondering if this approach is correct and allowing me to test what I want to test. If is in fact not correct or not testing what I want to know, I was hoping someone might provide some guidance on how to test this.

 Any help will be much appreciated.

 

Best regards,

Dear CAT12 users,

new version CAT12.9 is out with many updates for cortical surface extraction, spatial registration and preprocessing:
https://neuro-jena.github.io/cat/
http://www.neuro.uni-jena.de/cat12/cat12_latest.zip

Changes in version CAT12.9 (2550) in preprocessing pipeline (which affects your results compared to CAT12.8.2):
* The cortical surface extraction has been extensively updated with many changes that result in more reliable thickness measurements and better handling of partial volume effects.
* Initial affine registration now uses a brain mask to obtain more reliable estimates, resulting in more accurate non-linear spatial registration.
* Various smaller changes have been made for blood vessel detection and background detection for skull-stripping.
* Segment Longitudinal Data is now saving both plasticity and aging models by default.
* The previous cat_vol_sanlm from r1980 has been rescued and renamed to cat_vol_sanlm2180.m, which performs significantly better.
* The quartic mean Z-score is now used to assess sample homogeneity as it gives greater weight to outliers and makes them easier to identify in the plot.
* Several changes have been made to support Octave compatibility.

Best,

Christian

Dear Michael

From my understanding the FAST method is just a slightly more advanced (higher order) AR model, which still applies the same W matrix to all voxels estimated from som mask of voxels of interest. As the temporal autocorrelation is different in all voxels I imagine you risk introducing correlations if the W matrix is not the correct one for the voxel in question. I much prefer to use a Nuisance Variable Regression (NVR) approach in stead. With NVR where motion, cardiac and respiratory noise are fitted voxel-wise based on realignment parameters and external recordings of pulse and respiration. The latter is now much easier recorded (and saved in a non-image-Dicom file) if you use the CMRR multi band sequence.

Join the ReproPsy & e-ReproNim Fellowship Programmes!


Are you passionate about robust, rigorous, and transparent research practices in Psychology and/or Neuroscience? Do you want €1,000 or (slightly) more to fund training to enhance your skills in software and data management? Do you want to join a vibrant community of practice? Look no further!


This is a second call for the first edition of two Fellowship programmes, ReproPsy and e-ReproNim. These are unique opportunities to become part of a vibrant community dedicated to advancing open and robust data practices in Psychological and Neuroscientific research.


By becoming a ReproPsy Fellow, you will join a network of like-minded researchers dedicated to advancing data practices in Psychology and Neuroscience. Our programmes offer more than just financial support—it provides a platform for collaboration, knowledge sharing, and professional growth.


The project is led by Dr Jim Grange (Keele University, UK) and Dr Etienne Roesch (University of Reading, UK). They are part of the repro.school collective, and funded by the Research Data Alliance (RDA), in collaboration with the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC Future), and the UK Reproducibility Network’s Open Research Programme. 


The RDA aims to develop and adopt infrastructure that promotes data-sharing and data-driven research, thereby grounding the fellowship programmes in networks of data specialists.

ReproPsy is part of the RDA Psychology Data Interest Group;

e-ReproNim is part of the RDA Neuroimaging Data Working Group, and the European sister project to the North American repronim.org.


The UK Reproducibility Network is a grassroot movement, created organically by researchers in the UK in 2019, in response to the so-called reproducibility crisis. It now gathers active representatives of 70 research-intensive Universities in the UK and lead major projects. Other national Reproducibility Networks exist; there might be one closer to you? If not, contact us and we’ll help you set up.


Open Data in Psychology & Neuroimaging

In a context where results of research are questioned, open data is transforming the landscape of our practices, enabling collaboration, reproducibility, and innovation. As Psychology & Neuroscience embraces this paradigm shift, we aim to equip researchers like you with the necessary skills and resources to adopt and adapt your data practices, ensuring greater impact and scientific progress, and helping you help your community.


Project overview

The mission of the Fellowship programme is to empower communities to excel in open data practices. In each programme we are offering 15 fellowships, each worth up to €1,000, to support early career researchers (ECRs) from both EU and UK institutions. ECRs typically donate their time to upskill and transmit this new knowledge to their local communities. We expect the funding awarded to be directed towards helping you create opportunities for learning and teaching, helping you fund your own software and data management training, and organise bespoke training sessions at your home institution. The funding could for instance be used to organise training from the Carpentries (http://carpentries.org) or similar venues; or, should your local policies on workload allocation permit, you could use the funding to offset time commitment towards such training, in agreement with your line manager.


What we ask of you in return is a commitment to participate in the online events organised (at least once a month) and in the projects that may arise, such as scoping and designing training needs, contributing to writing training material, and other projects that you may bring to the table!


More information about the programmes and to access the application form (including dropbox link to submit letters of support, evidence of claims and invoices), please visit https://repro.school/2023/05/31/join-the-repropsy-e-repronim-fellowship-programmes/. 


Important: Because of constraints imposed on the funding, we must have received all claims and invoices for selected Fellows by the 31/3/2024. The deadline for application is 15/3, and applicants must include all claims and invoices in their application. Applications and documents sent after the deadline will not be processed. For enquiries about ReproPsy, contact j.a.grange@keele.ac.uk, and for e-ReproNim, contact e.b.roesch@reading.ac.uk.

Specifically, after applications are graded by our evaluators and ranked, we will assert the landscape of the selection and adjust the selection if needed. Please use the Special Circumstances box to raise to the attention of the evaluators anything you think may deserve consideration.

The ReproPsy and e-ReproNim Fellowship programmes are separate projects, yet have lots in common–starting with the application form! We thus regret to say that we will not accept applications to both programmes, and you must specify one or the other on the application form.

Funding is only available to applicants from institutions hosted in the EU and the UK. Because of the structure of the funding allocation, we are reserving 5 fellowships to UK applicants in each of the fellowship programmes, 10 out of 30 in total.

Information related to the transfer of the award will be shared with successful applicants after selection. Fellows will be required to have identified who at their host institution will be managing this financial transaction: typically a post-award or a finance office.

Applications are managed using Google Forms, and PDF uploads with Dropbox. Neither of these platforms require you to create an account on Google or Dropbox. We collect your name and email addresses on the Google Form to identify your applications. This information is not shared with anyone, and only used for general statistics and logistics of the selection process.



If you wish to be kept in the loop of what we do, please register to the Psychology Data Interest Group and Neuroimaging Data Working Group, with the Research Data Alliance. Alternatively, you can also visit our website.

 

PS: I usually only manage to look at emails, Teams and the like after 2pm. For anything pressing, please call me or book yourself in my University Outlook calendar.

I guess the former is non-parametric T and the latter is parametric, but not sure. In any case, the results are not the same.
This is correct. Furthermore, the the maps from the TFCE toolbox (i.e. T_log_pFDR) are without any threshold.
To be honest, I never use the FDR statistics in the TFCE toolbox, because I found the FWE correction always more meaningful.

>2) In the second case, when transforming SPM maps to logP_t{contrastname}_pFDR, if I want to calculate a unilateral contrast with 95% "confidence", should I go with the pFDR5 or pFDR10?
I am afraid that FDR will not provide this information.

Best,

We are looking to recruit a new postdoctoral associate for a large collaborative project on the anatomical development of the human cerebellum. The overall goal of the project is to develop a high-resolution normative model of human cerebellar development across the entire life span (see raynorcerebellumcharts.github.io). The successful candidate will join the Diedrichsen Lab  (Western University, Canada) and will work with a team of colleagues at Erasmus Medical Center, the Donders Institute (Netherlands), McGill, Dalhousie, Sick Kids, and UBC (Canada). A PhD degree in Neuroscience, Statistics, Computer Science, Engineering, Psychology, Medicine or related fields is required. Expertise in machine learning, analysis of medical imaging data, and/or normative modeling is highly desired. The project is funded for a 3 year duration, with the initial contract for 2 years. The exact starting date is negotiable, but is ideally as close as possible to the project start date, April 1st, 2024. Review of application will start March 5th and continue until the position is filled. For more information and application instructions, please see the full ad on our website.
