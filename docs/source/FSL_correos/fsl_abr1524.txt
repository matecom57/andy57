Hi,

Do FSL commands work when you use the call_fsl function? That is the recommended approach, rather than using the "!<command>" syntax.

Paul

Hello FSL Users,

I installed the FSL program on my Windows 11 computer according to the instructions provided on the FSL FMRIB site.
However, when I ran the 2nd level analysis in Feat, I encountered the following error.

Hi Manuel,

Thank you for sharing the useful information! The method you described sounds very promising. I will try it out.

I also appreciate you pointing me towards the paper.

I'm not familiar with ANTS, so it may take some time, but I'll report back on how it goes.

Thanks again,

Kikuko

Hi, 
Thanks for your reply
I think I said the wrong path. 
I wrote the same code in the path you mentioned.
But it still doesn't seem to work.
How do I fix that ?

Hi Keith,

That is strange - the update_fsl_release command worked for me on Linux and intel macOS. In any case, the easiest option would just be to re-install FSL instead of using the update_fsl_release command.

Hi,

I think the MATLAB startup file needs to be located in ~/Documents/MATLAB/startup.m for it to take effect.

Dear FSL experts,

I am currently using melodic to calculate group ICA on 24 subject's CIFTI files, representing 24 preprocessed and aligned sessions. The actual command I am using is:

melodic -i input.txt -o output_dir --CIFTI --nomask --nobet --bgthreshold=-1e10 -d 20 --report --Oall --tr=0.8

While inspecting the output 'melodic_mix', which contains the estimated mixing matrix for each fo the 20 components, each timeseries is, as expected, of length m=2*T-1, where T is the number of cifti timepoints. However, as you can see in the attached image, every single one of the pseudotimeseries blows out in value towards the end. I cannot see why this would be the case, since every subject is comparable and of same length T. In order to confirm that this was not caused by the last subject(s) covariance matrix being particular, I reran the aforementioned command (MIGP input order randomised by default) obtaining the same result every single time.

I expected an interpretable mixing matrix since, as the MIGP paper by Smith et al. states, "W becomes a running estimate of the final group-average set of spatial eigenvectors, and can be considered a pseudo-timeseries matrix of m ‚Äútimepoints‚Äù and v voxels."

To discard any other sources of error, I ran the same command again, but now without using MIGP:


melodic -i input.txt -o output_dir_nomigp --CIFTI --nomask --nobet --bgthreshold=-1e10 -d 20 --report --Oall --tr=0.8 --disableMigp

As expected, the resulting mixing timeseries are of length T*S where S is the total number of input sessions. Some exemplary timeseries are averaged across subjects and shown in the second attachement. By doing this, I can confirm that the mixing matrix looks as expected when not using MIGP.

Do you have any intuition why MIGP might cause this phenomenon on the mixing matrix?

Thank you very much,

Diego



Dear FSL Main list forum members,


Thank you so much for solving my previous problem.
I'm trying to use FSL in MATLAB, but I'm having problems.

First, I wrote and saved the FSL executable code in the Matilab startup.m file. 
The code is shown below.

% /Users/myname/matlab/startup.m
%------------ FSL ------------------------%
setenv( 'PATH' , [getenv( 'PATH' ) ':/usr/local/fsl/bin' ]);
setenv( 'FSLDIR', '/usr/local/fsl' );
setenv('FSLOUTPUTTYPE', 'NIFTI_GZ');
fsldir = getenv('FSLDIR');
fsldirmpath = sprintf('%s/etc/matlab',fsldir);
path(path, fsldirmpath);
clear fsldir fsldirmpath;

Then, I tried to run FSL inside MATLAB by using the system function or !
I want to run feat, so I enter that code on the command line.
There are no errors in the execution, but it keeps loading without producing any results. 

Î∂ôÏó¨ÎÑ£ÏùÄ Í∑∏ÎûòÌîΩ-1.png

Î∂ôÏó¨ÎÑ£ÏùÄ Í∑∏ÎûòÌîΩ-2.png

When I type that command to try and get the fsl gui to run, it looks like this, how do I fix it ?

Thank you for your attention and assistance.

Hello everyone, we would like to select the basolateral and central nucleus of the amygdala as ROIs for our analysis, using the J√ºlich histological atlas (i.e.: centro-median nucleus & latero-basal nucleus). Does anyone know how to extract regions from this (probabilistic) atlas?

Any help is highly appreciated!

Hi Shaun,

I'm considering the challenges of using the dHCP pipeline due to missing images. Therefore, I'll proceed with trying the BBR approach.
Your input on this matter has been very helpful in clarifying the issue.
Thank you for the discussion.

Best regards,
Kikuko

I haven‚Äôt done the neonate registration myself, but it looks like the dHCP pipeline uses BBR to the T2 template. It may be worth having a look at the dHCP processing pipelines for registration: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6299258/ and https://git.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/matteob/dHCP_neo_dMRI_pipeline_release

 

Thanks,

Shaun.

Dear Paul:

I just noticed something really weird. Probtrackv2_gpu would run when there is a concurrent process using the same GPU, but fails when there isn't any.

Unfortunately, no, I don't have reversed encoding data. Just dMRI in phase encoding direction of AP and T1w(mprage).

Thanks for the information. I have experience with Synb0-Disco. It worked very well for some data, but when I used it recently, it introduced some kind of artifact. So I didn't try this time. Anyway, I will try it.

> Once you have completed distortion corrections, you can do registrations following the FDT guide https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FDT/UserGuide#Registration_within_FDT. Note: for XTRACT you want non-linear warp fields (NIFTI files).

I think I followed that guide. Here are the commands I used.
(My FSL version is 6.0.7.6, and these commands and XTRACT usually work well for adult data.)


After preprocessing(including eddy and some other processes) and skull stripping,

flirt -in DTI.bedpostX/nodif_brain \
    -ref T1_brain.nii.gz \
    -omat DTI.bedpostX/xfms/diff2str.mat \

    -searchrx -180 180 -searchry -180 180 -searchrz -180 180 \

convert_xfm -omat DTI.bedpostX/xfms/standard2str.mat \
            -inverse DTI.bedpostX/xfms/str2standard.mat
convert_xfm -omat DTI.bedpostX/xfms/diff2standard.mat \
            -concat DTI.bedpostX/xfms/str2standard.mat DTI.bedpostX/xfms/diff2str.mat
convert_xfm -omat DTI.bedpostX/xfms/standard2diff.mat \
            -inverse DTI.bedpostX/xfms/diff2standard.mat

fnirt --in=T1.nii.gz \
    --aff=DTI.bedpostX/xfms/str2standard.mat \
    --cout=DTI.bedpostX/xfms/str2standard_warp \
    --config=T1_2_MNI152_2mm \
    --iout=T1_in_standard_space

invwarp -w DTI.bedpostX/xfms/str2standard_warp \
        -o DTI.bedpostX/xfms/standard2str_warp \
        -r T1_brain.nii.gz

convertwarp -o DTI.bedpostX/xfms/diff2standard_warp \
    -r /usr/local/fsl/data/standard/MNI152_T1_2mm_brain.nii.gz \
    -m DTI.bedpostX/xfms/diff2str.mat \
    -w DTI.bedpostX/xfms/str2standard_warp

convertwarp -o DTI.bedpostX/xfms/standard2diff_warp \
    -r DTI.bedpostX/nodif_brain_mask \
    -w DTI.bedpostX/xfms/standard2str_warp \
    --postmat=DTI.bedpostX/xfms/str2diff.mat


Then I run XTRACT Human_baby.

xtract -bpx DTI.bedpostX -out XTRACT_output -species HUMAN_BABY  -stdwarp DTI.bedpostX/xfms/standard2diff_warp DTI.bedpostX/xfms/diff2standard_warp -gpu


The result is attached to another mail.
When I overlay the images, i.e. Schuh_lowres, T1-brain, b0_in_T1_space, and T1_in_standard_space, they are obviously not the right size.

As I mentioned before, I only have a T1w structural image. But perhaps should I change the reference image to $FSLDIR/data/xtract_data/standard/Schuh40week/mri/schuh_lowres.nii.gz(it seems T2w, right?)? If so, what should I do with the fnirt config file?
Or do you recommend introducing a T1w template for newborns from another source?


Thank you very much for your help and time.

 

Kikuko

[You don't often get email from 000091f2afcdfdcb-dmarc-request@jiscmail.ac.uk. Learn why this is important at https://aka.ms/LearnAboutSenderIdentification ]

Dear FSL experts,

I'm currently working on neonatal tractography using XTRACT but am encountering issues with the registration process. The data I have comes from clinical settings, specifically diffusion MRI with a 64-axis scheme, and unfortunately, I don't have any field maps. The only structural image available to me is an mprage.

Could anyone provide guidance on how to successfully execute the registration under these conditions?

And I would like to confirm if the correct template for registration in XTRACT is:
$FSLDIR/data/xtract_data/standard/Schuh40week/mri/schuh_lowres.nii.gz. Could you please verify this for me?


Best regards,
Kikuko

Hi Michel,

It looks to me like a scanner reconfiguration (e.g. re-shimming) has taken place between the acquisition of these two images (see the attached screenshot). Topup expects the input image FOVs to match. Jesper may be able to advise further.

Paul

Hi Davide,

Your ROI image (L_dACC.nii.gz) is not defined in the same space as your diffusion data.  I'm not sure what space it is aligned to, as it doesn't match your diffusion or your structural images.

The ROI is aligned with the diffusion data when viewed in FSLeyes (i.e. they are aligned in the world coordinate system), but in order to use your FLIRT transformation matrix, the ROI image must also have the same voxel grid as the diffusion data.

On an unrelated note, even though it doesn't appear to have caused problems here, I would suggest running fslreorient2std on all of your images before any other steps so that they all have a consistent voxel orientation - your diffusion data has LAS voxel orientation, whereas your structural data has LIA orientation.

Paul

Dear Emily,

If you are using the transformed aCBF image output by asl_reg, then I believe that it will have been resampled to structural space using spline interpolation. While spline interpolation produces a better representation of the original data, it can introduce negative values. You can avoid this by using the .mat file output by asl_reg to transform the aCBF image yourself using trilinear interpolation, which will not introduce negative values.

On a separate note, registering native aCBF images to a structural image transformed to MNI through a 12 dof transform might introduce errors, as I believe asl_reg only performs a 6 dof alignment. In other words, asl_reg expects the structural image to be a rigidly (rather than affinely) transformed version of the aCBF image. As such, I would recommend first running als_reg from native aCBF to native T1 and then combining the resulting transformation with your  T1 to MNI transformation, before performing a single resampling of your aCBF image to MNI space (using trilinear interpolation).

Kind regards,
Rick

Dear Support,

We are finding that after we register our subjects' aCBF maps (produced by MRICloud software in native space) to the MNI brain, that the values are in some cases becoming negative. We started by l/r reversing our native M0 and aCBF maps for each subject (both generated by MRI Cloud), registered our aCBF maps to the MNI 2 mm brain with asl_reg using skull-stripped T1s for each subject that had been reoriented and registered to the MNI brain (12 dof with FLIRT), and then visually QC‚Äôd the registrations afterwards. We then extracted the values from the peak voxels in various ROIs, and found that many took on negative values (across several ROIs for most of our 38 longitudinal subjects: 33 at baseline and 31 at follow up). The MRI cloud generated aCBF maps in native space do not exhibit this behavior and have no negative values. Do you have any idea why we may be getting these negative values when we register the aCBF maps with asl_reg?

I will paste the command below for reference:

asl_reg -i PREV${i}_S${s}_ASL_real_aCBF_native_rpi.nii.gz --sbet PREV${i}_S${s}_T1_FS_RPI_MNI_brain.nii.gz -s PREV${i}_S${s}_T1_RPI_MNI_head.nii.gz -o asl_reg_aCBF-native_to_MNI

I read previously that using the perfusion image as the basis for registration was recommended, but did also test using flirt to 1) reg the M0 to the native T1 (6 dof), 2) reg the native T1 to MNI (12 dof), and then applied these transformations to the aCBF map, and found better registration results when using asl_reg.

If there is any other info I can provide that would be helpful, please let me know.

Thank you so much for your help!


Dear FSL community, We are running the FSL eddy_openmp command on our DWI data (108 directions, b-values from 5 - 3000 mm/s^2) for slice-to-volume motion correction. The main problem we see in our raw data is horizontal striping, likely due to motion and when we run the FSL eddy_openmp command it smooths some of the artifacts. In other cases, however, it does not fully remove these motion artifacts. Please see attached 4 photos representing 2 of our cases before and after processing: image 1: Case 1 - An example of our pre-processed data before eddy_openmp and topup (note the horizontal lines visible in the coronal and sagittal sections) image 2: Case 1 - An example of our data after eddy_openmp and topup (note that the horizontal lines seem to be improved slightly but not fully resolved) image 3: Case 2 - An example of our RAW data image 4: Case 2- An example of our data after eddy_openmp and topup These are the parameters in our configuration file: $ eddy_openmp: --verbose --data_is_shelled --niter=8 --fwhm=10,8,4,2,0,0,0,0 --repol --mporder=6 --slspec=/DSS_LRZ/01_Projects/REPIMPACT/installed_tools/PNLNYpipeline_2023/pnlNipype/slspec.txt --s2v_niter=5 --s2v_lambda=1 --s2v_interp=trilinear Is is possible that there is a particular tag that we could change to get this slice-to-volume motion correction to be stronger? Or, one that we could add? If so does anyone have any recommendations? Thank you in advance for your input! Best, Kate

Hi all,

A postdoc position is available for immediate start down under in Melbourne, Australia!

The position at Monash University involves working with neuroimaging data from the ABCD study to predict onset of non-suicidal self-injury in youths.

Hi all,

I‚Äôm looking to provide different tissue signal priors to FAST, but the documentation is a little sparse.

What does the signal prior file that can be provided by -s look like?


All the best,

James
