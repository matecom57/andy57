Dear Ines,

it is indeed good practice to have

spm_jobman('initcfg');

at the beginning of your script. And it is mandatory, if your batch variable construction code contains references to cfg_dep() or any SPM functions, e.g. 
spm_select() or anything like that. Thanks for explicitly sharing this advice.

Best,
Volkmar

Dear both,

Just adding a datapoint to this discussion. I experienced the same issue: 2 scripts, one running, the other stopping because of an "undefined cfg_dep" error. I 
was using the same Matlab installation and GUI (2022b), and was pointing to the same SPM folder.

I managed to solve the issue by adding `spm_jobman('initcfg');` in the beginning of the script, instead of calling it after the matlabbatch variable is defined.

Hope this helps other with the same issue.

All the best,

InÃªs Pereira
