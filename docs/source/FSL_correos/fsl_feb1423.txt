Dear all,

I set up a higher level analysis in FEAT with images as input which are not stored in a FEAT directory. I got the images running C-PAC on resting-state data (I don't want to use C-PAC for the analysis to be more flexible.). When I hit the "Go" button I get the following error message: "Registration has not been run for all of the FEAT directories that you have selected for group analysis." How may I skip this check if the images are registered or how may I tell FEAT that the images were already registered?

Thank you for your help and best regards,

Martin

Dear FSL experts,

I got a error when I ran fix script (fix log attached).
Could you help me please?

Thanks

Thanks Paul, that's done the trick (after restarting the terminal).

Hello,

I processed my DTI data through the TBSS pipeline and am now running an analysis using randomise to examine diagnostic differences (CN, MCI, AD) in the WM skeleton. The data were collected across 5 sites and I would like to account for the different sites in the analysis. I looked through the archives to understand how to set up a multilevel covariate in the analysis but I am unsure whether I should model the mean of the sites (example A below) or the intercept of each site (example B). What would you suggest?

Example A (modeling site means):
EV4 -1 for site 1, 1 for site 2, 0 otherwise
EV5 -1 for site 1, 1 for site 3, 0 otherwise
EV6 -1 for site 1, 1 for site 4, 0 otherwise
EV7 -1 for site 1, 1 for site 5, 0 otherwise

Example B (modeling site intercepts):
EV4 1 for site 1, 0 otherwise
EV6 1 for site 2, 0 otherwise
EV7 1 for site 3, 0 otherwise
EV8 1 for site 4, 0 otherwise
EV9 1 for site 5, 0 otherwise

Thanks in advance,
Jenna

Dear experts,
I encountered a strange issue with some of my single-subject preprocessing output.
Data from some of the runs seem to have been fully brain-extracted, and from others are not, i.e. voxels outside of the brain have non-zero (negative) values (please see the 2 screenshots from FSLEYES attached, together with the design files of both examples).

Normally, I don't believe it's a problem for stats calculation or otherwise (but please correct me if I'm wrong!) but we're using the filtered_func_data.nii.gz to calculate tSNR and the negative values outside of the brain are skewing our calculations. Besides, the inconsistency of masking is a bit worrisome, especially since we're using the same design file looped over the different runs/participants.
NB. the mask.nii.gz file in the feat output folder is created correctly.

I have rerun the datasets in question and the output remains the same.
Would you have any idea why this would happen and how to solve this?

Many thanks in advance.
Kind regards,
Olga Kepinska

I made sure that all the needed files are in the folder where I run eddy, to exclude pathname errors, including the topup outputs. By repeating the command, I got some other symbols:

Dear Jenna,

the two models should be exactly equivalent. I would slightly favour the former as I won't lead to a singular matrix (which may or may not be a problem depending on how things have been coded up).

Best regards Jesper

Dear Stella,

looking at your bvals it should be perfectly fine for eddy. I am not sure why it happens that some people report getting such strange error messages (??????A??U). Just the other day I looked at the data from someone who reported the same, and I got a sensible error message that allowed us to resolve the problem.

Can I just ask you to make sure that all the necessary files are available in the directory you are attempting to run eddy from? If you run it as part of a script, maybe you can run just one subject manually without any variable expansions in that directory.
Can I also ask you to send me the output of 'fslhd' on DWIs and on b0_brain_mask.

If we cannot solve it like that I will send you a link where you can upload your data so I can take a look at it.

Best regards Jesper

Hi Aisling,

So you are trying to call FSL commands from a separate Windows Python environment with fslpy installed? This is possible, but you need to set a FSLDIR environment variable in Windows​, so that fslpy knows where FSL is installed within your WSL installation.

You will need  to set the FSLDIR environment variable to something like the following (it may differ depending on the name of your WSL installation, and the location of your FSL installation within WSL):

\\wsl$\Ubuntu-20.04\usr\local\fsl\

You can read more about working across the WSL file system boundary at these links:

Subject: [FSL] FSL Python Wrapper Error
 
Hi,

I have been running FSL on my Windows 10 system for a while through the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL Ubuntu 20.04). I have now tried to set up the fsl wrapper in python (python version 3.10, and fslpy version 3.10) however I keep getting an error that FSL cannot be found.

specifically, if I try and run:

fsl.bet(('T1.nii', 'brain_extracted')

I get the error:
