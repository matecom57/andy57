Hi, I am planning hoping to attend the FSL course this year and I wondered if any knew when/where it is likely to be so I can plan ahead?
Thanks!

Hi Paul,

I followed your suggestion and it´s working now.

Thanks a lot!

Dear FSL experts,

I just finished running randomise looking at the association between the independent variable and white matter FA. Could you please let me know how I can check the direction of the results? Should it be through fsleyes or something other options are available? Thank you!

Best,
JW

Hi Paul,
Excellent, it absolutely makes sense.
Thanks so much for your this! 
Kind regards,
Olga

Hi Olga, 

It is not unusual for a small number of voxels within the brain mask to be negative, as long as the brain mask is reasonable, and there are only a small number of negative voxels. You may need to use a more conservative mask for your tSnR calculations.

Dear FSL experts,
I'm reaching out again regarding the below issue with single-level FEAT preprocessing.
Your input will be much appreciated.
Many thanks,

Dear experts,
I encountered a strange issue with some of my single-subject preprocessing output.
Data from some of the runs seem to have been fully brain-extracted, and from others are not, i.e. voxels outside of the brain have non-zero (negative) values (please see the 2 screenshots from FSLEYES attached, together with the design files of both examples).

Normally, I don't believe it's a problem for stats calculation or otherwise (but please correct me if I'm wrong!) but we're using the filtered_func_data.nii.gz to calculate tSNR and the negative values outside of the brain are skewing our calculations. Besides, the inconsistency of masking is a bit worrisome, especially since we're using the same design file looped over the different runs/participants.
NB. the mask.nii.gz file in the feat output folder is created correctly.

I have rerun the datasets in question and the output remains the same.
Would you have any idea why this would happen and how to solve this?

Many thanks in advance.
Kind regards,
Olga Kepinska

Hello,

I am trying to run my first level fMRI analysis and it takes some time to run on my local machine. As a result I am thinking of running some subjects on the cluster of my university as well, to save up time. The issue is that my version is FSL 6.0.5 and on the cluster they have FSL version 6.0.3 installed. For them to install the updated version it takes them around or more than a week (with unclear results if it will work) so I wanted to ask if it is possible to use some subjects analysed with the version 6.0.3 and some with the 6.0.5 for the second level analysis.

For clarity the steps that I am using in the first level are:
BET extraction, spatial smooting with 5 mm, highpass filter (50 s), FILM prewhitening, but no thresholding on the post stats. Also while I am doing a simple registration, my data are from fmriprep and already registered.

Would anyone have any input around the feasability of this?

Best,

George

Hi Paul,

thank you very much for the answer. I followed the instructions, but it didn't work at first.
With Tom Nichol's help it worked after we copied dc to $FSLDIR/share/fsl/bin/.

Hi Ludovica,

I am planning to assist this year.

How much it will cost?

Thank you!

Dear Jun,
To find the direction ( of significant results ) you just need to refer back to the original design/contrasts.

Hope this helps,
Kind Regards

Dear Abhineet,
The process below assumes parametric stats and so will not use randomise’s non-parametric calculations. To run FDR on FEAT/randomise outputs, you could change the correction mode to “Uncorrected” in the GUI - after running the analysis the “pstat<blah>” images in the .feat folders’ stats subdirectory will contain the uncorrected ( 1-p ) values that could then be processed with FDR.

Hope this helps,
Kind Regards
Matthew

Dear Matthew,

Thanks for the quick reply.

I run randomise inside the FEAT GUI and choose uncorrected as thresholding option. I want to perform FDR correction. Should I use the following command on stats/cope1.nii.gz?

            https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FDR:
           Use with FEAT

            Change directory into the stats sub-directory. It is then necessary to convert a give cope and varcope image into a p-value image. For example:

            ttologp -logpout logp1 varcope1 cope1 `cat dof`
           (this outputs the log(p) image)

          fslmaths logp1 -exp p1
       ◦ (this creates the p-value image)

          fdr -i p1 -m ../mask -q 0.05

       ◦ Probability Threshold is:  0.00339819 (this tells you the FDR threshold - p-values below 0.00339819 are significant)

        fslmaths p1 -mul -1 -add 1 -thr .99660181 -mas ../mask thresh_1_minus_p1
       ◦ (this creates a 1-p image for ease of display, thresholds that at 1-thresh and then remasks)






Hi Holly,
My mistake - please read “zstat” as “tstat” in my previous email. Other answers inline with questions below.

Hi Matt,
Thank you. Hmm, I have not created a z-stat image but only have a raw t-stat image and a corrp t-stat image. From there, I used the below command, which gives a list of clusters, peak coords, and a COPE-MAX for each cluster. (this is a DTI TBSS analysis if it matters)

   - Corrected 1-p values with associated t-statistics (as output from randomise):

   cluster -i blah_blah_corrp_tstat1 -t 0.95 -c blah_blah_tstat1 --scalarname="1-p" > cluster_corrp1.txt


Since I have not created a z-stat image, are the COPE-MAX values t-stats?
Correct, for the “all-in-one” call like this, the COPE-MAX values would be the ones to report ( and will be t-statistics )

If I made a z-stat image and inserted it here [-c blah_blah_tstat1], would the COPE-MAX value then be a z-stat?  
Yes, although since we are dealing with non-parametric stats, if you are transforming the tstat image to a zstat image, this is essentially producing "parametric equivalent" z-scores.


Hope this helps,
Kind Regards
Matthew
Many thanks!!!
Holly
