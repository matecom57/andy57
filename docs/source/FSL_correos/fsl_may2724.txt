The squirrel data sharing format is now available in beta format and we're looking for public comment. The squirrel format is designed to use the minimum number of objects to describe all parts of neuroimaging analysis. From experiments and raw data to analysis methods and results, all information can be categorized into 10 object types. Using a hierarchical storage, the format can store any number of subjects, any number of imaging sessions, any number of visits, and any modality of data. It handles not just imaging data, but demographics, measures, vitals, and drugs.

Simple to use, simple to share.
* convert from DICOM to squirrel
* convert from BIDS to squirrel
* modify existing packages
* packages are in 7zip format, and JSON is human readable
* available for RHEL8, RHEL9, and Debian12/Ubuntu22

The squirrel utilities are in beta, so not all parts work, but we're looking for testers and feedback!

Download the squirrel utils from https://github.com/gbook/squirrel/releases
Documentation and the squirrel specification: https://docs.neuroinfodb.org/nidb/contribute/squirrel-data-sharing-format/squirrel-utilities



Hi,
Not that I’m aware of, but if you multiply the image beforehand by 1000 (e.g., fslmaths image -mul 1000 tmpimage), or some other appropriate value, you can achieve what you are looking for.

I saw someone had this issue but solved by themselves (should it be the answer) with motion outlier correction.

I have run fsl motion outliers command and successfully included the matrices for all my subjects. I did verify my matrices and they seem fine to me and according to my design. I ran other subjects the same exact way before that gave me no error.

So to provide the information that was required in that 2019 message to someone else, that Mathew Webster answered:
My data is processed on macOS Mojave with 24 GB RAM.
Where can I send the required files? i.e  files of the 3 matrices (1 x 3 runs), the filtered_func_data.nii.gz and the desing .mat, con and fts files.

Thank you so much!

Kind regards,

I also just found the specifications for the new eddy version, I will read it intently.

Ämne: Re: [FSL] eddy cuda versus open_mp
 
Hi Nick,

I'm guessing that you are using a slightly older version of FSL - eddy has undergone some fairly substantial changes over the past few FSL versions, so I would recommend reinstalling the latest version of FSL (6.0.7.11 at the time of writing).

eddy_openmp performs similarly but slower that eddy_cuda, but slice timing corrections are only available with cuda. Correct?
The CUDA and CPU versions of eddy are both feature-complete, but the CPU version is obviously slower than the GPU version. The CPU version of eddy now uses native C++ threading for parallelising instead of OpenMP; you can specify the number of threads to use via the --nthr option.

You should be able to just call the "eddy" command - this is a wrapper script which will call the CPU or GPU version depending on whether a GPU is detected.

Which is the latest version of cuda that the current fsl version is compatible with? 12.1?
The FSL GPU tools are compiled against CUDA 10.2, and should work on any GPU that supports that version or newer.

is there any new information on how to circumvent the "error while loading shared libraries: libcublas.so.9.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"?
This problem should not affect recent FSL versions, as we now statically link the CUDA libraries into the executables. So all you need to do is make sure that your system has a NVIDIA CUDA driver installed - you don't need to install the full CUDA toolkit.

Paul

Subject: [FSL] eddy cuda versus open_mp
 
Ladies and Gents,

I am having issues with cuda-eddy after performing a major file clean up on my computer.

I just want to check:
eddy_openmp performs similarly but slower that eddy_cuda, but slice timing corrections are only available with cuda. Correct?

Which is the latest version of cuda that the current fsl version is compatible with? 12.1?

is there any new information on how to circumvent the "error while loading shared libraries: libcublas.so.9.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"?
I managed to solve that issue before I did my major file clean up, and now I cannot remember the solution....I am getting old.

Any help much appreciated.

Dear Ruiqing,

 

    1. There is only one phase encoding direction of the DTI data which is "PhaseEncodingDirection": "j-", can I skip "topup" and start from "eddy" in DTI processing?

 

Yes, you can do that and in that case "eddy" will still correct your data for eddy current-induced distortions and subject movement. But the data will still be "in the wrong space", i.e. be distorted.

An alternative would be to use Synb0 (https://github.com/MASILab/Synb0-DISCO) to generate a distortion free "synthetic" distortion free b=0 volume from your T1 structural data. You can then use that in "topup" together with your actual b=0 volume to estimate the susceptibility field.

 

    2. There is "Binary brain mask" input option in "eddy", and also "BET binary brain mask" input option in "DTIFIT Reconstruct diffusion tensors". How many times shall I conduct BET? Once or twice? If once, when shall i conduct the BET, before or after "eddy"?

 

It should be enough to run BET once. If running topup I would recommend running it on the --iout output from topup. If not, you can just run it on the first b=0 volume in your data set. You may need to experiment a little with the -f parameter of bet, I find that I often have to lower it (from the default of 0.5) on diffusion data.

   

    3. How to set acqparams.txt (Acquisition parameters file) and index.txt (Index file) needed for "eddy"?  I have "PhaseEncodingDirection": "j-" and "TotalReadoutTime": 0.0507233 in the JSON file, and set the acqparams.txt as "0 -1 0 0.0507233". Is this method correct? Since I have only one phase encoding direction in my DTI data, there is only one line in my acquisition parameters file. Is it acceptable?

 

That looks good to me.

 

I've seen on the internet that the index file can be set from the bval file, can you provide a code on how to get the index file?

 

Hmm, guess that if you want to involve the bvals file you could do something like.

 

nvol=`wc bvals |  awk '{print $2}'`

ones=""

for ((i=1; i<=$nvol; i++)) do

  ones="$ones 1"

done

echo $ones > my_index.txt

 

I agree that is a little awkward, and in the future there will be an option to just specify --index=ones in eddy, and that will automatically be expanded to the correct number of ones.

 

Jesper

 

   

    Thank you very much!

   

    Best regards

I forgot to mention - after creating the .wslconfig file, you will need to run restart WSL - you can do this from a WSL / Ubuntu terminal by running:

wsl.exe --shutdown

And then opening a new WSL / Ubuntu terminal.

Paul

Hi Aziz,

It sounds like you are still using the built-in Wayland server. You may need to disable this by creating a file called .wslconfig in your Windows home directory (i.e. "C:\Users\<your-username>\.wslconfig")
which contains the following text:

[wsl2]
guiApplications=false

But note that I am hoping to have a new version of FSLeyes released very soon which will with the built-in WSL Wayland server, and will not require VcxSrv to be installed.

Paul


Thank you for this suggestion; this is for sure something we will consider.
I have carefully reviewed the documentation of the HCP pipeline, but I am afraid this doesn't fully answer my question yet.

I am still trying to understand if there is a relationship between the dimensionality of the group-level ICA and the SNR in the group-level components resembling RSNs and/or the power of the subsequent analysis on these components (e.g. group comparisons).
Do you have any insights on that?

Hi Tiago,

You should be able to install FSL  6.0.6.1 with the fslinstaller.py script, which you can download from https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsldownloads_registration

And run with a command such as:

python3 ~/Downloads/fslinstaller.py -V 6.0.6.1 -d ~/fsl-6.0.6.1 --miniconda  <miniconda-url>

where you should replace "<miniconda-urL>" with one of the following URLs, depending on the system you are installing FSL onto:
https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-py310_24.4.0-0-Linux-x86_64.sh
https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-py310_24.4.0-0-MacOSX-arm64.sh
https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-py310_24.4.0-0-Linux-x86_64.sh

Hi Matt,


Thank you for your swift response.
It could well be that there is some noise left. Our imaging parameters are quite similar to HCP (3T Siemens, TR/TE: 846/30ms, 840 volumes, 2.2mm isotropic voxel size, MB factor of 6) but not identical. However, we used the FIX version pretrained on the HCP data as none of us are very experienced in manually labeling components.
Would you recommend any additional cleanup steps?


Also, our cohort is substantially older than the HCP-YA (mean age of 50 years). Would you expect the age of the cohort to influence the optimal dimensionality? And is there a measure one could use to estimate the optimal dimensionality?


Thanks again and best,

After sICA and tICA denoising, we found d=76 to be optimal for the 3T HCP-YA data.  If you are finding group level noise components at low dimensionalities, perhaps the sICA+FIX cleanup left in some noise?

I am running an analysis of HCP-like resting state data of 45 patients and 34 healthy controls.
I have implemented the minimal processing according to the HCP pipeline and used ICA-FIX (pre-trained version of FIX) for cleanup.
I have also already run several group-level ICAs with different dimensionalities (ranging from 10 to 35 in steps of 5), and now I am trying to decide which one to use for further analysis (e.g., group differences with dual regression and permutation tests using randomise).


I was wondering whether the chosen dimensionality might influence the SNR of the data and thus the power of the subsequent analysis. I noted that using a larger number of components, e.g., 30, leads to more group-level noise components which I could regress out (i.e., not use them for further analysis). On the other hand, I assume (and please correct me if I am wrong, this is just my assumption) that the splitting of large RSNs (e.g., the default-mode network) into several components might lead to less power for finding group differences within that RSN. Or am I completely off track with that assumption?


Does anyone have any insights on whether and, if so, how the dimensionality affects SNR of the decomposed data and the power of the analysis? Is there a way to estimate (t)SNR of the decomposed data and/or power?


Thanks a lot in advance for your support.


Best regards,
Madeleine

Dear FSL Team,

I have a question in regards to going about a gPPI-Analysis in FSL. I have a "Multiple Subject - Multiple Session"-Design with 2 Tasks I want to compare and 2 Groups of people I want to compare. I have set up my different level analysis as follows:

First Level:
EV1: Task Regressor Task 1
EV2: Task Regressor Task 2
EV3: Seed Physiological Regressor
EV4: Interaction Task1*Phys
EV5: Interaction Task2*Phys

Contrasts:
C1: [1 0 0 0 0]
C2: [0 1 0 0 0]
C3: [0 0 1 0 0]
C4: [0 0 0 1 0]
C5: [0 0 0 0 1]
C6: [0 0 0 1 -1] -> These are to compare my two tasks
C7: [0 0 0 -1 1] -> These are to compare my two tasks



The Second Level now simply takes the mean of the runs across one subject for each contrast 5-7 (relevant to my analysis).

On the third Level the setup looks as follows (for every of the 4 copes I passed up from the second Level):
EV1: Regressor for group 1
EV2: Regressor for group 2

Contrasts:
C1: [1 0 ]
C2: [0 1]
C3: [1 -1] -> to compare my groups
C4: [-1 1] -> to compare my groups


Does this design makes sense to compare how the difference in the tasks changes across two groups?

If I am not providing crucial information, please let me know and thank you in advance for your time and help!


Best regards,

Leon Scholz

Hi Aziz,

At the moment, you need to install and use vcxsrv (or similar) in order to use FSLeyes under WSL. You need to make sure that you have started xlaunch before starting FSLeyes - this is outlined in the FSL installation documentation at https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/docs/#/install/windows?id=install-a-x11-server-vcxsrv

Hi,

I would like to have access to the 6.0.6.1 version of fsl. How can I get the installation file fsl-6.0.6.1.tar.gz?

Thank you in advance.

Dear FSL-team,

 

we tried to run a seed-based resting-state functional connectivity analysis using feat. Even though we exactly followed the instructions provided on this website (https://neuroimaging-core-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/fsl_fmri_restingstate-sbc.html), our higher-level output indicates perfect correlations between the OFC (our seed region) and regions all across the brain (see attached), which seems very unlikely.

 

During the analysis, we started by extracting our ROI (i.e.: the OFC) from the harvardoxford atlas in 2mm thr50. After binarizing this mask, we put it into the functional space of each subject. Subsequently, the ROI timeseries was extracted using the following command:



Then, we ran the first-level analysis (see design attached) and higher level (design attached), putting the wholebrain standard mask in ‘pre-threshold masking’ and received the suspicious results that you will find in the attachment. Since the first-level results already show correlations of the OFC with the whole brain we suspected that this part of the analysis might not correctly display the brain regions that show correlations with the mean OFC activity.

 

Furthermore, we ran the exact same design with a centromedial-amygdala mask as ‘pre-threshold masking’ and the results for this one seem more reasonable. However, since the OFCxwholebrain analysis appears suspicious we were wondering whether something within the feat analyses went wrong.

 

Any help on how to check whether the analysis went correctly/how to fix this issue would be very much appreciated!

 

Best regards,

Frieda

 

 

 

Dear experts,


I am trying to conduct a resting-state analysis with MELODIC.
When feat starts the software crushes. The following output is shown in the terminal:

child process exited abnormally
    while executing
"fsl:exec "${FSLDIR}/bin/feat ${fsfroot}.fsf -D $FD -I $session -init" -b 10 -N feat1a_init -l logs "
    invoked from within
"if { $done_something == 0 } {

    if { ! $fmri(inmelodic) } {
       if { $fmri(level) == 1 } {
              for { set session 1 } { $session <= $fmri(mult..."
    (file "/Users/tomee08/fsl/bin/feat" line 390)


I am using a Mac with an M3 pro processor and with Sonoma 14.5.
The Python version is 3.12.

Thank you for helping me to continue further with the analysis.

Sincerely,
               Tom

Hello,

I am new to fsl. I just installed it and opened fsleyes. It works great but I can't modify the overlay display settings or the view settings. I click on the settings button, a new window opens and I can't interact with it. I try checking/unchecking things or using the sliders but the window does not respond. I can't even close it. I have to go back to the main fsleyes window and click a second time on the settings button.

Any help would be appreciated. Thank you in advance!

FIX requires:

melodic_mix – component timeseries in a text file as columns.
melodic_IC.nii.gz – component spatial maps as z-stats after mixture modelling (can do only mixture modelling with melodic).
 

We are enabling FIX after ICASSO in the HCP pipelines. 

 

Matt.
