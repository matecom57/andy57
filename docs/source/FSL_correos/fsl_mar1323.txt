Hello Karina,

I believe what went wrong is that under --trainingnums you specified the numbers of the subjects, but it should be the number of the row in your masterfile where the files of that subject can be found. For example you specified 37 under --trainingnums, but there is no row 37 in your masterfile. For 37 you should have passed the number 16 which is the row of subject 37. I hope this solves your problem!

Best wishes,
Tanja

Dear all,

The Headache and Orofacial Pain Effort (H.O.P.E.) Lab at the University of Michigan requests applications for a postdoctoral position to work on migraine, fibromyalgia, and TMD research programs funded mainly by the National Institute of Health. The programs use novel methodologies in neuroimaging and neuromodulation to investigate and target central mechanisms of chronic pain in vivo.

Extensive knowledge of neuroimaging analysis software systems as well as programming experience is required, as is some level of comfort with novel neuromodulatory protocols. Previous research experience and publications with positron emission tomography (PET) and/or MRI-based neuroimaging methods and analyses are also needed.

We are seeking applicants with advanced degrees and strong self-motivation to work in a highly creative, altruistic, and mentoring environment with students and residents from different departments across campus. The applicant will be exposed to several tech innovations, many developed in-house, for clinical translational pain research (e.g., migraine, TMD, dental and cancer pain), such as mobile technology, multimodal neuroimaging (PET, MRI, fNIRS, EEG) and neuromodulation montages (TMS and [HD]-tDCS).

HI,

I am facing this weird issue where BET is consistently eliminating a major part of the brain. The outputs are also surprisingly consistent across multiple fractional scaling and other settings There are no logs, and BET runs successfully without any errors. I couldn't find any relevant discussion on the issue. Strangely, extraction with alternative tools like Robex produces a better result from the same input file.

    Dear Experts,
   
    As part of the multi-session tensor-ICA an s-mode report with negative and positive values is generated in relation to each component/network. My question is what a positive versus negative s-values actually means?. Furthermore, if a component's s-values are correlated significantly with a behavioral measurement like IQ for example, is it a way to find out the direction of the correlation between the two variables?
   
    References on the subject will be greatly appreciated.

Hi Lin,

This issue is fixed in the latest version of eddy_qc. You can update your FSL installation by:

	1	Run "update_fsl_release" to update your FSL installation to the latest available
	2	Run "update_fsl_package -u fsl-eddy_qc" to install the latest version of the eddy_qc package.

Hi!
I’m running a first level analysis on fMRI data using feat, including the preprocessing steps.
I’m generating the .fsf file based on a template, then calling feat generated.fsf.
When I do it this way the analysis fails during registration, apparantly because it’s looking for some example_func file or some such - but really the errors and stack are quite cryptic.

The thing is that when I open the GUI and load the exact same .fsf file and hit ‘Go’ - the analysis completes without problems.

I’d appreciate any help - thanks!

Hi Alexander,

The wiki link is out of date (I'll update it now). You can download the FSLVM zip file from:

fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsldownloads/FSLVm7_64.zip

However, I would recommend using WSL instead if at all possible, as it provides a much nicer experience than using a VM.

Hi Alessandra,

The resulting affine is essentially an identity matrix, but boundary effects like this can occur with affines that contain very small offsets - the boundary slice in the input image will have been placed just outside of the field-of-view of the reference image (or vice-versa).

Have you considered adjusting your code so that the firstvol->firstvol registration is skipped?

Subject: [FSL] FLIRT - an image onto itself
 
Hi FSL experts,

I am writing you as I have just noticed something quite curious, by chance.

For a different reason, I had to realign several splitted volumes to the first volume of a dataset, and I then realigned the first volume to itself, as it was embedded in a for loop.
To my surprise, I noticed that doing flirt with an input equal as the reference image, doesn't give the identity matrix as a transform, regardless of the degrees of freedom used (I tried with 6 or 12). Apart from the transformation matrix, I also noticed that a slice gets 'cut off' for apparently no reason ( I can see this when I open with fsleyes the difference image between the output of the realignment and the original input.
Has this something to do with the -cost function used? Have you ever experienced this issue?

Thanks in advance for your help!


Code used:
flirt -in ASL_vol_1.nii.gz -ref ASL_vol_1.nii.gz -out ASL_realigned_vol1_6DOF.nii.gz

Transformation matrix:

Subject: [FSL] FSLMERGE
 
Hello FSL community,

I have an error in concatenating masks from first level for a group level analysis. I could spot the cause of error --in the fslmerge command line, while listing the inputs, a seemingly random 0 is included between two files in a list of many other inputs. This throws an error that says child process exited abnormally. In the terminal window, I double-checked if removing 0 from fslmerge would be solution and it works. Is there a fault in my GUI FEAT file setup or elsewhere that throws in this random 0? Pls let me know how I can have FSL run fslmerge in the correct manner from GUI.

Error spot:
fslmerge -t mask /Volumes/....../mask 0 /Volumes/......./mask

Thanks,
Suja

Hi Zack,

The FreesurferEnv.[sh|csh] scripts will also add $FSLDIR/bin to your $PATH. There is an open pull request on the Freesurfer github repository to fix this, but it has not yet been merged:

https://github.com/freesurfer/freesurfer/pull/1072/files

In the meantime, you could edit the FreeSurferEnv.sh script in your Freesurfer installation so that the FSL_BIN variable is set to $FSLDIR/share/fsl/bin/, instead of $FSLDIR/bin/.

Hi Paul,
Thanks for your help very much! I did what you suggested, but it doesn't seem to solve my problem.
When I installed FSL, I added the following lines to /etc/profile.

export FSLDIR PATH

As shown above, I did not add $FSLDIR/bin/ to $PATH. Will the configuration of other software (such as FreeSurfer) affect FSL, and what should I do next to solve the problem?

Thanks again~~~

Hi Karina,

This has been fixed in the latest version of FSL. If you don't want to update your FSL installation, you can work around this by opening $FSLDIR/bin/bianca_overlap_measures in a text editor (e.g. nano), and changing the very first line from "#!/bin/sh" to  "!#/bin/bash".

Hi Matthew,

 Thank you so much for your reply. I am a total beginner in FSL and fMRI data preprocessing, so I couldn’t fully follow what you were saying. Yes, I am following the standard FEAT pipeline. What should I be doing if I want to get the standard space representations for each participant? I am not sure how to get the “resampled into standard-space” data. Should I change the “preprocessing” on top to something else? Could you guide me through this? Thank you so much for your time.

Dear FSL users,

Apologies if this has already been asked, I'm new to FSL.

I've done my first TBSS analysis on some brain tumour data and I'm currently in the process of checking the location of the areas of significantly low and high FA. I'm using tbss_deproject to assess if the FA is coming from the location of the tumour.

So far, I've run the commands:

fslmaths tbss_tfce_corrp_tstat1 -thr 0.95 grot
tbss_deproject grot 1
tbss_deproject grot 2

These were successful. However, one of the things I've noticed after I've run 'tbss_deproject grot 2' is that the areas of significantly high and low FA have grown larger in the image, i.e. they cover a larger area. The results look a little similar to tbss_fill when used to highlight areas of significant FA change compared to controls.

I assume this has something to do with the back projection to the native space of the patient, but I was hoping someone could explain why this is occurring?

Best wishes and thank you -

Emily

Hello,
What would be the optimal training dataset for BIANCA in the following case:
I have 25 subjects:  2 subjects with a Fazekas score of 0, 11 subjects with a Fazekas score of 1, 7 subjects with a Fazekas score of 2, and 4  subjects with a Fazekas score of 3.
I chose for my training dataset 6 subjects:  1 subject with a Fazekas score of 0, 1 subject with a Fazekas score of 2, and 4  subjects with a Fazekas score of 3.
The results I got from the BIANCA run were unsatisfactory, and I wonder whether I should've chosen a different training dataset, in terms of number of subjects/WMH load.

fsl_glm -i filtered_func_data_clean -d component_time-series --out_z --demean --des_norm -m template_vol

The outputs are z-score maps.

The extant literature seems to be divided in terms of what to use for second-level (i.e., between-subjects) analysis. Some use voxel-wise z- / t- / r-scores and some use voxel-wise beta coefficients from the regression. The former makes more sense to me in terms of the following toy example. Case 1: for a given voxel time-series, the slope (beta) of the regression equation is fairly steep and the predicted data all lie quite close to the regression line (low residual noise); Case 2: for a given voxel time-series, the slope (beta) of the regression is the same as Case 1 but the predicted data are scattered more around the regression line (moderate residual noise). In terms of computing functional connectivity with a seed or DR-based regressor, Case 1 seems to convey better functional connectivity than Case 2. Using, say, a z-score [which conveys a signal (beta) divided by residual noise] captures the Case 1 versus Case 2 difference whereas using only a beta weight evaluates the two cases as equivalent.

Now, finally, to my actual questions:

1. Are there flaws in my logic for preferring z- / t- / r- scores? Is there anything to be gained by using betas?
2. Is the format of our fsl_glm command (using --out_z) rendering the "right" thing? In particular, I really want to make sure that it's not, for example, creating for each subject a distribution of all voxel values within a mask and then assigning z values to voxels based on where they lie in that same distribution.

Thanks for any advice / guidance!

Dear Lara,

it is indeed possible to get values higher than one, counterintuitive as it might feel.

When using Jacobian modulation (which you would normally do) the "intensity values" consist of two parts. One is the probability of the voxel being gray matter, which of course can never be greater than one. The other part is the "Jacobian modulation", which is there to compensate for any stretching/compression of the gray matter.

The comparison (stats) will be performed in the space of your template (MNI152 or custom), so all the images have been warped into that space. Now consider a subject with thicker cortex, such that in order to fit his/her into a gray matter voxel in the template it had to compress two of the subjects gray matter voxels into the one in the template. Since we are interested in "gray matter density" in VBM we want to take that into account. And we do that by multiplying the value of that subjects voxel by the Jacobian of its warp, in this case by 2. Let us further say that the two voxels in that subjects original space both had a probability of 1 of being gray matter, we will end up with an "intensity value" of 2 in that voxel for that subject.

I hope that helps.

Best regards Jesper

Hello everyone,

I am attempting to apply a method described in the article "Spatial regression analysis of MR diffusion reveals subject-specific white matter changes associated with repetitive head impacts in contact sports" to my data. The method involves permuting voxels in pre- and post-FA maps and subjecting them to spatial regression. To do this, I need to use anisotropic, non-linear smoothing on my FA maps. I am wondering if SUSAN is a suitable tool for this purpose, and if so, how should I use it? Additionally, I would like to know if FSL offers a better solution for my needs. Thank you in advance for your assistance.

Best regards,
Batel

Hi,

I am running the preprocessing and registration of one subject using the FEAT GUI (version 6.0) with 4D resting state fMRI data, MP2RAGE (T1w) images and MNI 1mm resolution standard space image.

Is this normal?

Also, an error appears in my terminal (twice):

Hello,
I would be happy for your help with the BIANCA tool.
I created a folder with subjects for the BIANCA run, that looks like that:

I've attached the masterfile.txt to te mail.

I ran the following command line:

bianca --singlefile=masterfile.txt --trainingnums=1,2,19,23,25,37 --labelfeaturenum=4 --querysubjectnum=1 --brainmaskfeaturenum=1 --featuresubset=1,2 --matfeaturenum=3 --trainingpts=2000 --nonlespts=10000 --selectpts=noborder -o 3/bianca_output -v

What could be the reason for that?

Thanks Shaun. Yaa most of them are empty, so probably related to data quality. Regarding the xtract_stat, do I need nifti file for the standard2diff or matfile is enough? I only output matfile during flirt, can I still run xtract_stats ? Also just to confirm that I am not doing something wrong, I am pasting a part of my script for xtract here, would be great to get your confirmation.

Hi Nabin,

1. 

For some of these tracts/subjects, it would be best to visually check the images. Is there any tract found, or is the image empty? If there is some tract but of low quality, you could adjust the threshold you use.
Empty tracts may relate to data quality, particularly for SLF and AR, which can be tricky to track in lower quality data. 
For the MCP, it may be worth checking the coverage of the data. Is the cerebellum always included?

It will likely be the case that some subjects will always be missing some tracts due to data quality.


2. 

Xtract_stats is an easy way of getting tract stats. It gets the mean/median e.g. FA, MD, etc… It uses fslstats to do this. I’m not sure how exactly you are using fslmeants but I think, in principle, you can achieve similar results to xtract_stats. 

Thanks,
Shaun.

Hi shaun, 

Hope you are doing well. Following up on our previous conversation, I have couple of questions. 

1. I extracted the values from the tracts and surprisingly there are some tracts whose values are missing. I extracted those for about 2000 subjects, so I could observe a pattern and it is always the same tracts where there are zeros, specifically slf (90% of subjects have zeros), ar (70%) and cst, mcp, fx (40%). It made me think now is there something fundamentally wrong that I am doing here? I do not get any error messages, so I am finding it hard to decode what is going on. Do you have an idea what is going on here ? 

2. Since the last time we talked I saw that there is a new(?) command called Xtract_stats which extracts the stats from the tracts. I extracted the above using fslmeants commands. Is there is a difference on how Xtract_stats extracts the values? 

Please let me know if you would want more details. 

Thank you.

Yes, the FA extraction process is basically the same depending on how it’s run, etc.. XTRACT is basically a wrapper around probtrackx: it calls probtrackx with pre-defined anatomical constraints and applies some further processing steps, e.g. for the reverse-seeding. So, you can treat the outputs very similarly.

There are many zeros in the images, mostly in the non-brain regions. And after thresholding, there will be many more zeros again - values less than the threshold value have been set as zero but will still be included in the “-m” mean calculation. Using the non-zero “-M” option is best in this case.

Regarding your AF waytotals, I generally find lower waytotals for the tractsInv run - the scale of the difference in this case may be related to data quality. Best to check the general appearance of the tract to make sure it has worked as expected. 

Thanks,
Shaun.

Thanks Shaun, I was reporting the values from arculate fasciculus. So,the FA extraction is similar to the one after probtrackx but only difference is I guess the thresholding and native space transformation. Sorry to bother you a lot but one more thing while using the fslstats mean using the -M or -m has huge difference in the fiber lengths or probability distribution. Why would that be ? I understand that it is with or without zero voxels but should there be lots of zero voxels in there ? I cannot wrap my head around. Just to be in safe side, I should use the bigger M, right ?

Thanks again.

Hi,

You’ll want to use the densityNorm.nii.gz file. With that, you can apply a consistent and meaningful threshold to remove the very low probabilities.

It is possible to have large differences between the waytotals as the size of the seed and target masks may be very different depending on the tract/protocol. Out of interest, which tract are you reporting here?

To get FA, you can now threshold and binarise the densityNorm files using fslmaths to get a tract mask. Typical threshold values are 0.001 or 0.005 - best to apply threshold and inspect the mask to see whether it is fit for your purposes. e.g. fslmaths densityNorm -thr 0.001 -bin densityNorm_bin

Once you have a binary mask, you can multiply it by the subject’s FA map to get a tract specific distribution of FA values. Depending on how you have run XTRACT, you may need to transform the tract mask (or densityNorm) to the subject’s native space prior to multiplication (assuming the FA map is in the subject’s native space).

Thanks,
Shaun.

Thank you Shaun. So, should I use "sum_density" or only "density" file in that case. Also, could it be that the waytotal is significantly different between the seed to target and when it is swapped, I can understand some variation but in one of my tracts the waytotal outside has 37717 and inside the tractINV folder is only 982. Could that be ? Or there is something wrong there. 
Sorry for too many questions but if I want to get the FA values from these fibers now, is it possible ? If so, how and which of the output should I use and how is the thresholding done if needed. 
Thanks a lot again for you kind support.

Hi Nabin,

1. For some of the tracts, we use a "reverse-seeding” approach. i.e. we run tractography with a seed and target, then we repeat tractography after switching the seed and target (target becomes seed and seed becomes target). The second run is stored in the tractsINV folder. After running both, the results are summed for the final probability distributions. So, you want to use the files in the parent/tract directory.

 2. The "density.nii.gz" file is the fibre probability distribution. The "density_lenths.nii.gz" file contains the fibre lengths, each voxel is the average streamline length - this is the "-ompl" probtrackx option. The "densityNorm.nii.gz" is the waytotal normalised fibre probability distribution. Just the "density.nii.gz" divided by the total number of valid streamlines. So fslstats mean will give you the mean of the probability distribution, the mean of the length of fibres and the mean of the normalised probability distribution respectively.

Hope that helps!

Thanks,
Shaun.

We are looking for a researcher who can contribute expertise in analysis of multimodal imaging data, in applying machine learning methods across brain imaging, device-based and clinical data emerging from existing studies specific to Parkinson’s disease (PD and RBD cohorts), and to translate disease-specific imaging biomarkers into unselected population brain imaging data in UK Biobank. The post holder will optimise image pipelines, and create new pipelines, to convert and process raw imaging data. They will also produce progress reports and, when possible , publish and present research results to the international community in collaboration with the PIs. The post holder will employ machine learning tools to data across the different data sources to identify candidate disease biomarkers, including multiple modalities from each data source. The successful candidate will hold a DPhil/PhD degree (or nearing completion) in neuroscience, engineering, physics, mathematics, statistics, or other relevant field. They will also have experience of MRI-based neuroimaging analysis and advanced skills in statistical analysis using Python, MATLAB, R, SPSS or similar. It is desirable that the candidate has advanced skills using FSL and experience analysing large data sets.

Dear experts,

After running VBM and randomise, I got one cluster that survived FWE-correction and thresholding at 0.95. I extracted the median intensity values for that area for each participant in my sample and noticed that about 10% have median values larger than 1. I know that the values should range between 0 and 1 - does anyone know what may cause the >1 values and whether or not I need to be concerned?

Thank you in advance!

Kind regards,
Lara

Hi FSL experts,

I am writing you as I have just noticed something quite curious, by chance.

For a different reason, I had to realign several splitted volumes to the first volume of a dataset, and I then realigned the first volume to itself, as it was embedded in a for loop.
To my surprise, I noticed that doing flirt with an input equal as the reference image, doesn't give the identity matrix as a transform, regardless of the degrees of freedom used (I tried with 6 or 12). Apart from the transformation matrix, I also noticed that a slice gets 'cut off' for apparently no reason ( I can see this when I open with fsleyes the difference image between the output of the realignment and the original input.
Has this something to do with the -cost function used? Have you ever experienced this issue?

Thanks in advance for your help!


Code used:
flirt -in ASL_vol_1.nii.gz -ref ASL_vol_1.nii.gz -out ASL_realigned_vol1_6DOF.nii.gz

Transformation matrix:
