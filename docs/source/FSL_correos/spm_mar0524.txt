Dear Sanaz,

the SPM batch system and the various extension mechanisms (toolboxes, spm_orthviews, fieldtrip...) require more knowledge than just compiling spm.m as a target function. SPM comes with a MATLAB .m-file spm_make_standalone.m that will take care of the necessary steps to compile SPM from within MATLAB. You should give it a try on your SPM installation. If you want to customize your standalone SPM (by e.g. adding extra toolboxes etc) you may need to make some changes to the code.

Hope this helps

The newly established Cognitive Neuroscience & Neurotechnology group led by Dr. Romy Lorenz is looking for two enthusiastic PhD students (m/f/d) to join our growing team at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics in Tübingen, Germany.
Our lab focuses on advancing our understanding of the frontoparietal brain network mechanisms that underpin high-level cognition and adaptive behaviour. For this, we pursue an interdisciplinary research programme that allows studying this brain system at multiple levels of granularity. Our methodology involves subject-specific brain-computer interface technology, fMRI at 3T and ultrahigh (i.e., 7T and 9.4T) magnetic field strengths (for resolving cortical layers), EEG, non-invasive brain stimulation as well as machine learning. You can find out more about our work at:    https://www.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/711763/cognitive-neuroscience-neurotechnology
We are seeking two ambitious PhD students who will work on the exciting field of ultrahigh resolution fMRI that allows to investigate the human cortex at the scale of layers and columns. 
The ideal candidates should have a master’s degree in cognitive (neuro)science, psychology, computer science, biomedical or electrical engineering, physics, or related disciplines. A strong background in fMRI data analysis (e.g., FSL, Freesurfer, ANTS) and very good programming skills in Bash on Linux, Matlab and/or Python are required. Prior experience in MRI data acquisition and experience with ultrahigh resolution fMRI (e.g., at 7T) is desirable but not necessary. Equally, experience with machine learning-methods, code sharing platforms (e.g. GitHub) and high-performance computing clusters are highly desirable.
The Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics offers a world-leading research environment with access to the latest cutting-edge MRI hardware (including a Siemens 9.4T and Prisma 3T for humans as well as a 14.2T small animal system) and other excellent research facilities (EEG, eye-tracking, fMRI-TMS). The PhD student will receive generous support for professional travel and research needs (~2500€/year). Additionally, the student will have the opportunity to become part of the Graduate Training Centre of Neuroscience that provides training courses, summer schools and conferences to further educate doctoral students. Further, the Institute is part of the TübingenNeuroCampus (with more than 100 active groups), offering a vibrant community of international researchers and enriching environment of collaboration.
The position is available from May 2024 on and remains open until filled. The salary is paid in accordance with the collective agreement for the public sector (65% TVL-E13, amounting to ~2000€ net per month).

Dear experts,
Based on page 643 of EANM guideline for brain PET imaging (Guedj, Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging, 2022, 49:632-651), “since version 8, SPM is available as a stand-alone tool”. However, I have not found the executable file of SPM 12 but the m files. Please kindly let me know if the exe file is available and the method to obtain it.
Best regards,

Dear experts,
Just following up on my query regarding the spm implementation of high pass filtering, in case anyone had insights,
Thank you,

Hello experts!
I was trying to understand an oddity I observed with high-pass filtering in spm. 

Basically, I constructed a signal = y1+ a*y2; 
y1 = sinusoid whose freq > hpf_cutoff, ie. it shouldn't be filtered out
y2 = sinusoid whose freq < hpf_cutoff, ie. it should be filtered out. 

The issue I'm having is that the filter gives different results based on "a" above (MATLAB code @ end of this email). Thinking from a brick wall** -type filtering POV, this shouldn't happen... the result of filtering "signal" above should be y1 everytime, independent of "a".  

1.  Reading the documentation, I realized that SPM implements high-pass filtering using DCT.... why do we prefer filtering fMRI data with a DCT filter, since as the above case shows, a brick wall filter seems to be more accurate? 
2. Thinking of y2 as "noise", it's almost as if the output is dependent on the scale of noise (captured by the scaling factor "a" above). Is this the right way to think about it/ Am I missing something here?

Thank you!
Mayank


**By brick wall, I mean doing an fft, and nulling all frequencies above hpf_cutoff, followed by an inverse fft. 

MATLAB Code: ===================
L = 1024; %<length of signal
filter_100s = ...          %< filter with hpf_cutoff = 100s
                     spm_filter(   struct('RT', 1, 'HParam', 100, 'row', 1:L)   );


y1 = sin(2*pi*[1:L]/50 )';         %< sinusoid with period = 50s,  shouldn't be filtered
y2 = sin(2*pi*[ylim1:L]/350)'; %< sinusoid with period = 350s, should be filtered


y_filter_test1 = spm_filter(filter_100s,    y1+50*y2); %< 'a' = 50
y_filter_test2 = spm_filter(filter_100s,    y1+.1*y2);  %< 'a'=0.1

figure; subplot(3,1,1); plot([y1 y2]);
           subplot(3,1,2); plot(y_filter_test1);

Hello,

Background : I'm currently running a study in which I wish to examine the effects of cognitive training on brain activity across time, in pre-selected specific ROIs. I have 3 cognitive training groups and 3 timepoints (therefore 3 fMRI scans per participant that each represent a different timepoint).

Problem : Using MarsBar, I am extracting parameter estimates (betas) within specific ROIs from pre-existing One T-tests done in SPM. However, when extracted, I noticed that the values change slightly depending on the N (number of participants included in the One T-test) and on the timepoints included.

More specifically, this is what was done :
1. The first time extracting betas, I used a One T-test that included a single training group's scans across all 3 timepoints.
2. The second time extracting betas, I used a One T-test that included all three training groups across one time point only.

Interestingly, beta values at Time 1 stayed the same regardless of the One T-test used. However, beta values at Time 2 and Time 3 changed slightly at the decimal level.

Question : I have two questions.
1. First, what is the reason these beta values can change?
2. Second, what is the most appropriate One T-test to use, given my research question?

Thank you for your help.
Sam.

Brain, Body, and Self Laboratory, Department of Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet

 

The Department of Neuroscience comprises multiple research groups focusing on diverse aspects of nervous system function in both normal and diseased states. Our research encompasses a wide array of studies, ranging from molecular and cellular levels to neuron networks and the overall organization of the nervous system. This includes four labs dedicated to cognitive neuroscience. The Department maintains a flat organizational structure with 40 research group leaders, including 24 full professors, alongside 65 PhD students and 35 postdocs.

 

The Brain, Body, and Self Laboratory (Group Ehrsson) uses neuroimaging and behavioral methods to study how we perceive our own bodies as unique objects distinct from the external environment (www.ehrssonlab.se). We aim to characterize the perceptual rules and brain mechanisms whereby a central representation of one's own body is constructed by integrating signals from the different sensory modalities (e.g., vision, touch, and proprioception). We also investigate how central body representation influences how we think, feel, and remember ourselves and how the external world looks to us. Our laboratory has expertise in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), psychophysics, and other behavioral approaches (including virtual reality technology and robotically controlled bodily illusion setups). We have local access to two state-of-the-art 3T MRI scanners, one 7T scanner, and one MEG scanner.

 

We are seeking a highly talented, innovative, and enthusiastic researcher who has been awarded a Ph.D. in cognitive neuroscience or a related field within the past two years. The successful candidate will work on projects focused on body representation, bodily illusions, multisensory integration, embodied cognition, or processes related to bodily self-awareness, including the sense of body ownership.

 

The ideal candidate should possess expertise in experimental psychology or cognitive neuroscience, with a preference for skills in psychophysics and computational modeling, and/or proficiency in neuroimaging methods, especially multivoxel pattern analyses, and/or experience with human electrophysiology (EEG, MEG) or brain stimulation methods (e.g., TMS). The candidate will be expected to work within the framework of our research program (www.ehrssonlab.se), yet will have considerable freedom to develop their own ideas and project proposals. The ability to work independently, initiate and lead novel research projects, and prepare high-quality draft manuscripts for research articles is crucial. Applicants must demonstrate an excellent academic track record, including high-quality publications in international peer-reviewed journals.

 

The application must me uploaded via the Karolinska job recruitment portal: http://ki.varbi.com/what:job/jobID:687736/

 

An application must contain the following documents in English or Swedish:

A complete curriculum vitae, including date of the thesis defence, title of the thesis, previous academic positions, academic title, current position, academic distinctions, and committee work
A complete list of publications
A summary of current work (no more than one page)
 

Deadline: April 22nd, 2024 (extended deadline)

Dear Benedetta, 

Apologies for the late response. I think a 0 is missing in DCM.C, for now it is a vector of size 6, so n = size(C,1) in spm_erp_priors has value 5, and the matrix Q is initialised with shape (5,5) instead of (6,6), causing the error. 

Hope that helps, 

All the best, 
Johan 

Dear experts,

I conducted a traditional PPI analysis in SPM. However, the group analysis results of this PPI appear odd:

The whole-brain activation pattern of the PPI interaction regressor closely resembles the activation pattern of the total of all conditions in my experiment (contrast: condition 1+ condition 2+ condition 3+condition 4+ condition 5 + condition 6). They're pretty the same.

I’m uncertain what went wrong. Could this be due to the necessity of using gPPI in this case? Any insights would be appreciated.

Experiment setup:
• Conditions: 6 (condition 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
• Contrast for testing experimental manipulation:
(condition 1+ condition 2+ condition 3) – (condition 4+ condition 5 + condition 6)

Analysis:
Used standard PPI with a weight matrix: [1 1 1 -1 -1 -1]
The code is:


	 abatch{1}.spm.stats.ppi.type.ppi.u =     [1 1 1
	                                           2 1 1
	                                           3 1 1
	                                           4 1 -1
	                                           5 1 -1
	                                           6 1 -1];

Thank you !
