Dear experts,

We recently tried to run TBSS on nonhuman primates (Squirrel monkeys) 
Typically we run the following code
tbss_1_preproc *.nii.gz
tbss_2_reg -t Template/Saimiri_template0.nii (this is our squirrel monkey template)
tbss_3_postreg -S
tbss_4_prestats 0.2

however, TBSS always runs the following (visible in the terminal)
affine-registering target to MNI152 space
transforming (and upsampling) all FA images into MNI152 space

This is a bit impractical since the squirrel monkey brain is much smaller than a human brain.
How can we replace this with our template or skip this step?

Thanks a lot for your input 
Kind regard

mich

Stam, 

Thanks for the help!

So we have run bedpostx a couple of times and we are able to replicate our results but we are not able to replicate the original run that someone else in the lab ran. 

Do you know if input files are changed by bedpostx? We are copying the same input folder they ran for their run. 

And for running with a --seed flag. Is it possible to see if a run had a seed flag?

Hi Anna

 

Bedpostx has run-rerun variability by design, as it does a stochastic estimation (i.e. during estimation random number generators are used in various steps).

 

This is not something to worry about, but if for some reason you need to exactly replicate results between runs (e.g. for debugging purposes) you can do that by setting the --seed flag to a fixed number. This will fix the sequence of pseudo-random numbers and will return identical results across runs.

 

Hope this helps

Subject: [FSL] Bedpostx question

 

Hi,

We have a question regarding running bedpostx. We have run the
following command on the same input files and for some reason our
output files are different (mean_dsamples.nii.gz,
mean_d_stdsamples.nii.gz, mean_S0samples.nii.gz,
merged_ph1samples.nii.gz, merged_ph2samples.nii.gz,
merged_th1samples.nii.gz, merged_th2samples.nii.gz) in the cal_max and
cal_min lines. As we run the rest of the pipeline our final values are
also different so we believe this is making a difference. What we
can't figure out is why the output is different .

Does running bedpostx change the input folder?
Is there generally some difference in running bedpostx multiple times?
Another question, if we ran the original input folder along with 200
other input folders would the output change vs running it only on one
input folder (how we ran that is the code below)

#how we run on a single folder
module load fsl/6.0.3
bedpostx [folder with the 4 input files] -n 2 -w 1 -b 1000

#how we run on multiple folders
module load fsl/6.0.3
cd [directory]
for d in *; do
bsub -J BEDPOSTX -n 1 -P acc_psychgen -W 100:00 -q premium -M 10000 -R
"rusage[mem=5000]" -oo ~/"bedpostxinfo."$d".stdout" -eo
~/"bedpostxinfo."$d".stderr" bedpostx $d -n 2 -w 1 -b 1000;
done

thanks,

Sure, I would be happy to share.  Can you send me an email or link to share with you?  Or if you send me an off-list email, I could send you a link to data I upload.

Hi Joel,

 

May I ask if you could share your data and design (off-list)? Somehow it seems there are infinities, but they shouldn’t be present unless with exceptionally high stats.

 

Also, add -nouncorrected, since the issue could be with the uncorrected p-values (and consequently, drop -fdr).

 

In any case, the gamma approximation is often as good as the Pareto, so it could also be an alternative.

 

All the best,

 

Anderson

I'm trying to run PALM with seed-based WM tractography maps as inputs but am running into errors.  I can, however,  get seed-based fcMRI maps to run using the same subjects, same test scores.  My input is as follows (and I've verified that my 4D file looks OK):

 

Running PALM alpha119 using MATLAB 9.8.0.1323502 (R2020a) with the following options:

 

-i /input/group4D.nii

-m /input/mask.nii

-d /input/CPSP_design.mat

-t /input/CPSP_contrast.con

-n 2000

-save1-p

-twotail

-accel tail

-fdr

-T

-o /output/testOutput

 

The groups are a bit unbalanced (38 in one group (test score=1), 87 in another (test score=0)) but, again, this works fine for fcMRI seedmaps.

 

PALM builds the null distribution, completes, then chokes when computing the p-values:

 

Computing p-values.

Error using interp1 (g:154)

The sample points must be finite.

 

Error in andersondarling (/palmpath/palm-alpha119/palm_pareto.m:196->interp1)

Error in palm_pareto (/palmpath/palm-alpha119/palm_pareto.m:128->andersondarling)

Error in palm_saveall (/palmpath/palm-alpha119/palm_saveall.m:77->palm_pareto)

Error in palm_core (/palmpath/palm-alpha119/palm_core.m:2469->palm_saveall)

Error in palm (/palmpath/palm-alpha119/palm.m:81->palm_core)

 

The only matlab function in PALM that I could find using "interp1" was palm_pareto, also referenced in the errors.  When I re-run palm using all the same data, but removing "-accel tail", I get significant results.  Is there a bug in palm_pareto or a reason to expect it to fail under certain conditions?

Hi all,

We’ve been trying some new preprocessing techniques in the lab, while continuing to use FSL for the “statistics” stage of analysis. However, we’ve ended up in a situation where first-level analyses work great, but second-level results (across runs within participant) always turn up suspiciously empty.

 

It’s not the data. An all-FSL analysis of the same data shows strong results. (Test contrast is a basic movement>rest.)

 

This says to me “problem registering/warping first-level functional space results up to second-level structural space” (since FEAT is not auto-creating the reg directory, since preprocessing isn’t in FEAT), but I’ve tested that. I created a script to manually create the example_func2highres and example_func2standard files for the reg directory. This script works fine for a normal all-FSL pipeline, but not for my externally-preprocessing pipeline.

 

I’m hitting my head against a wall troubleshooting this. What else could make strong first-level results completely disappear from second-level analysis?

 

Happy to share whatever files/info might be useful.

 

Thanks,
