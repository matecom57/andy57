Hi Saad,

Thank you for the explanation. Could you clarify one more thing? If I use the —kurt option for the multishell data, the FA and other diffusion parameters are calculated based on the kurtosis model already?

Hi Jun

 

The DTI model is a bad fit for multishell data that spans this bvalue range, and fitting it to multishell will tend to bias the parameters. The correct thing to do is to extract one shell, or you can use a kurtosis model.

 

Have a look at this tweet from last September: https://twitter.com/SaadJbabdi/status/1567554211012923394

 

It shows (and shares) a FSLeyes plugin for diffusion where you can easily compare DTI and kurtosis fits and the resulting parameters. I hope it is helpful to you.

 

Cheers

Subject: [FSL] Multishell Data dtifit Question

Dear FSL experts,

 

I just ran dtifit on multi-shell dti data and extracted b1000 from the multi-shell data. The images look like below. The left one is the FA image from the entire multi-shell data and the right one is the FA image from the b1000 extracted from the multi-shell data. Their FA values are different on the same location (the left one: 0.908, the right one (0.888).

 



 

I am wondering how dtifit works on multi-shell data. Could you please let me know how it decides the b value from the multi-shell data? Thank you!

 

Best,

Jun

Hello,
I have a question concerning the GLM model.
As far as I know, when I use a GLM to fit data in software packages such as (R, statsmodels in Python) I need to define a link function, the so called "family" (it can be binomial, gaussian, gamma, poisson, etc).

In the context of FSL, how does the link function definition work?

Kind regards,

Hello,

We are trying to do slice timing correction in FEAT. "Use slice timings file" and then select the json file output by MRIcron. Please see the attached example.

FEAT errors out with "Could not find enough numbers in matrix". Number of slices is 72 and the json file has 72 values. Could you take a look at the json file to see what might be causing problems?

On a broader note, slice acquisition on our scanner is interleaved. Should we just pick the Interleaved option instead of trying to use the json file? Would that be easier without much of a tradeoff?

Thanks,

Hi,

I'm glad you found that option. The ADNI advanced protocol (also used by several other studies) uses the same b values, with 6 directions at b = 500, and many more at b > 500 s/mm^2, all in approximately isotropic shells. But with a minimal number of directions at b = 500, and no great need for more, it does tend to run up against eddy's default opinion of what constitutes a shell.

Best regards,

Rob

I post this just as an update: I have solved the problems I had with eddy_cuda.

I had the correct version of CUDA, so I tried to run eddy_cuda on other diffusion data, and it went well.
The problem with the new diffusion dataset was that the diffusion data included several b-values (b=0,500,1000,2000), and I had omitted the flag --data_is_shelled.
With that flag added at the end of the command, eddy_cuda ran without a hitch!

I thank you again for your support and quick reply, which were both much appreciated!

Hi Malathi,

Are you specifically trying to install an older version of FSL? If not,
can you download the latest version of the installer from https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FslInstallation.

Note that the installer script was rewritten just a couple of months ago, and so if you are using a version that you have previously downloaded, it may be out of date.

Dear Gordon,

the best way to check if your results are valid is to check the perfusion image and the values you obtained. In the image (perfusion.nii or perfusion_calib.nii) you should clearly distinguish the GM to the WM (since WM has much lower and less reliable values). The logfile would give you as output the GM and WM means, with calibrated values between 40 and 80/100 in the GM (this is very approximative: some patients, especially on your age range, might have lower values) and around 20 in the WM.

Regarding region analysis: I usually check the Mean value in the region_analysis.csv that you obtain. However, I am not entirely sure if this is the best way: for example, in the same file you have also a precision-weighted mean and median. Moreover, there is also a region_analysis_gm.csv file : not sure if this last one is a more valid table when you want to check only for your GM values. Perhaps in this mail list there's somebody that uses different parameters than me for his analysis and that can give you better explanations regarding this last topic..

Hope that clears.
Best,

Lorenzo Nigris

Dear all,

Thank you kindly for your help, I have been able to get some results from the regional analysis within BASIL. I still have a few questions; firstly, what do people normally use as their output values – to me it seems as though you would use region_Analysis.csv unless you had a specific need to measure gm/wm regionally?

Also, how do people check that their results are valid? I have checked the perfusion.nii image, which I can tell is slightly different for one of my results (the first patient below). Does anyone have any sources of normative data? I have included some of my results from three patients I have analysed. Seemingly the first one has some different results compared with the latter two, unsure why. Otherwise, do the results seem vaguely ok? I have only included x5 regions of interest.

60 year old healthy man: perfusion_calib_gm_mean = 45.2
                                 : perfusion_calib_wm_mean = 18.4

Yes, I use default of 5000 samples per voxel. When a fiber enters terminate region, the tracking stops right away. Therefore, the only non-zero voxels from fdt map in the termination will be on the edge of the termination. Adding them up gives the number that survived. This should be close to waytotal, but as Saad explained, a single fiber entering termination twice will receive a count of 2, whereas for waytotal will be incremented by 1.

Seed region is different. Its entire volume is used for seeding, not only its edge. Therefore, a fiber started deep inside the seed will have to pass through the edge of the seed. Thus, edge voxels will have counts of the fibers that start there and survive, plus fibers that stared deep, passed through the edge and survived. I thus expect total of seed to be much larger than the total of termination. But in some cases I see termination has 25% more of the survived fibers than survived in the seed.

Saad explained that termination region (and in fact any region) can have two ends of the same fiber. (A voxel can not have both ends because this is not allowed by tracking, but two neighboring voxels in termination can have two ends of the same fiber that started at a seed.) Seeing 25% more terminate than leave, means that at least 25% go from seed to termination with both ends. Maybe it is realistic? The track is between two FreeSurfer regions: from ctx-rh-unknown to ctx-rh-parahippocampal.

Roman


Hi Roman,

I guess it depends on the size of your seed ROI and the number of samples you prescribed.  The fdt map represents how many samples launched made it through whatever waypoints or termination you defined.  If you send out 5000 samples per voxel, not all of them make it.  The value of each voxel within fdt map is the number of samples that "survived".

The waytotal is the number that DO make it, whatever route they choose to get there.  I would threshold your fdt map based on a percentage of the waytotal, eg drop the lowest 10%.  If waytotal is 3330, threshold w 333. 

To me, it doesn't make sense to add up the fdt counts, as this can vary from scan to scan due to movement, noise, etc.  Best to evaluate in reference to the waytotal on a scan-to-scan basis.
