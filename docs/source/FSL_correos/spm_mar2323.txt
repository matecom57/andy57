Dear Jose,

during model setup SPM uses so called "stick functions" to model responses. These have a value of "1" for some time points, and "0" everywhere else. If you specify zero duration SPM will place just one "1" at the time where you specified the onset. If you specify a longer duration, SPM models a sequence of "1"s beginning at your onset and ending at onset+duration. Later on, these stick functions are convolved with your basis function (set) and the resulting time series are placed in your design matrix.

You observed that a strictly event related design does not capture the time course in your data, while a design using prolonged events does. There might be technical, physiological or neuropsychological reasons for this.

Technical: your timing is slightly off (e.g. due to incorrect synchronisation between scanner and experiment, wrong calculation of timing offsets if you manually discarded some scans at the beginning of your MR measurement). In that case, fixing the timing should get you a good chance to analyse the data as planned.

Physiological or neuropsychological: The timing is correct, but you are observing responses that have longer or delayed BOLD responses compared to a canonical hemodynamic response (e.g. reaction time experiments). These differences may even be region specific, and you should model them accordingly. Some possible solutions include using temporal and dispersion derivatives together with the hemodynamic response function or explicit modelling of responses as separate experimental conditions. The latter will only work if stimulus presentation and response are far enough separated in time or e.g. variable according to reaction times.

Best regards,
Volkmar

Hello everyone,
While preprocessing the fMRI data for spatial noise we get multiple options in the realignment. I am a bit confused about the options "Ralign:Estimate & Realice" v/s "Realign & Unwarp" in SPM12. Can someone please help me understand the difference between the two and explain the basis to choose one of the 2 options for realignment step.

Hi Noelia, 

To my knowledge, I suppose they are statistically comparable and both suitable for your aim. Actually, they are roughly the same in terms of reducing the number of comparisons. In most cases, they should generate similar results.

However, there is a minor difference in the scope of the generated statistical map. 

When using SVC, a statistical map is generated based on the whole brain, and SVC segments a piece of the map without influencing the remainder. Then, SVC only adjusts the statistical threshold within that piece of the map, i.e., the topological features (smoothness, peak, cluster, etc.) won't change from start to finish.

When adding an explicit mask, the statistical map is generated based on the inner-mask voxels, i.e. ,the topological features differ from those of the whole-brain statistical map, because it is technically a whole new statistical map. 

Intuitively, due to the distinction of the topological features, the cluster-level inferences might produce more discernible disparities than the voxel-level inferences would. 

Sorry but I could only provide some general opinions, which method to adopt still depends on your experimental design and many other factors. 

Best regards,
Mu Nan

Dear experts,

In our fMRI study, there are three blocks (Block 1, Block 2, Block 3) and in each block, there are 25 trials. In each trial, there are five conditions (Baseline, Computation, Anticipation, Feedback, Win/Loss Status). In Block 1, participants win at a 80% rate, in Block 2 they win at 48% and in Block 3 at 20%. The order is Block 1-Block 2-Block 3 for all participants.

We expect connectivity differences in different networks depending on the block (e.g. default mode network during Block 1, frontoparietal network during Block 2, salience network during Block 3). We want to perform a gPPI analysis on our data but we want to make sure that it is okay to compare the blocks overall (Block 3 > Block 1, Block 3 > Block 2 etc), disregarding the conditions.

Would it be problematic to do this? Would aggregating all conditions in one block prevent us from detecting expected network differences that could be related to the effects of the conditions?

Thank you in advance.

Best,
Birce

Dear SPM experts,

I'd appreciate if you could help us resolve a methodological question concerning a group-level analysis.

In our study, we are interested in looking at the activations within the singing network in stroke patients performing a singing task. The singing network was determined using an independent dataset of demographically-matched healthy participants based on our a priori hypothesis that the patients will show different activation within this network.

Our first approach was to use this singing network from healthy controls as a small volume correction in the results from the patients group. The volume of this singing network represents 12.5% of the total number of voxels.

The second approach was to use the singing network as an explicit mask during the 2nd level specification.

Are both approaches statistically comparable? Which one would be more suitable to test our hypothesis?

Thank in you in advance for your help.

Best wishes,
Noelia

Postdoctoral Researcher Positions: Section on Affective Neuroscience and Pain, Division of Intramural Research

https://www.nccih.nih.gov/about/jobs/postdoctoral-researcher-positions-section-on-affective-neuroscience-and-pain-division-of-intramural-research

 

Dr. Lauren Atlas’s laboratory is recruiting one to two postdoctoral researchers with expertise in fMRI and affective science to join the Section on Affective Neuroscience and Pain (ANP) to lead new projects on the psychological modulation of pain and emotional experience. Dr. Atlas’s lab is part of the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health’s (NCCIH) intramural research program, and affiliated with the Intramural Research Programs of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). Learn more about the NIH Intramural Training Program.

 

Research in the ANP Lab focuses on the mechanisms by which expectations, learning, and other cognitive and affective factors influence pain, emotion, and clinical outcomes. We combine approaches from experimental psychology, neuroimaging, psychophysiology, and computational modeling to investigate pain and emotional experience in healthy individuals as well as individuals with chronic pain and/or affective disorders. We are particularly interested in the intersection of appetitive and aversive learning, how psychosocial factors influence pain and clinical outcomes, and questions motivated by pain’s central role in the opioid crisis. Postdoctoral researchers are expected to develop their own projects, with guidance, and to collaborate with other researchers in the lab as well as in the broader NIH community. We are looking for someone to spearhead new projects using high field imaging (7T-FMRI) to examine pain and perception across domains and/or using simultaneous PET-MRI to study the role of dopamine and opioids in pain modulation. Clinical collaborations to look at the intersection between pain, mental health, and/or substance use disorders are also possible. 

 

The candidate should have a strong background in psychology and neuroscience and must have received a Ph.D. in a relevant field by the time of appointment. Candidates with successful publications in the fields of pain, emotion, and/or computational modeling are encouraged to apply. Postdoctoral positions require experience with 1) design of behavioral and fMRI experiments, 2) analysis of fMRI data using statistical parametric mapping packages (SPM, AFNI, etc.), and 3) programming and analysis skills in MATLAB, R, and/or Python. These requirements will be flexible for candidates with clinical experience or experience in psychopharmacology, as we are currently planning clinical collaborations. Appointments and salary are commensurate with research experience and accomplishments (www.training.nih.gov/programs/postdoc_irp).

 

The candidate will be supported with the excellent intramural NIH fellowship in a stimulating and interactive research environment at NIH. NIH has exceptional multidisciplinary research facilities including structural and functional MRI, MEG, PET, and TMS. Our lab is fully funded with dedicated weekly scan time, a full-time data analyst, and the opportunity to work alongside some of the world’s foremost fMRI experts. Training in advanced imaging and other techniques is available, as are courses in grant writing and career development. Trainees can also apply to be fellows in the Center on Compulsive Behaviors, a trans-NIH fellowship program. This is an exciting and collaborative environment for those interested in pursuing a career in clinical or cognitive neuroscience.

 

How To Apply
Applicants should submit a CV, a brief description of research interests and career goals, and the names of three references to Dr. Lauren Atlas (Investigator/Chief, Section on Affective Neuroscience and Pain, NCCIH/NIMH/NIDA, NIH). Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis.

 

Applications will be accepted until the position is filled.

Dear Martina

Thanks for posting this great reference. Am I correct that figure 3 shows, that physiological modelling is needed even if FAST18 is used? It would have been great to see if Volterra expanded motion regressors (24 parameters) can reduce/remove the peak at low frequencies still present in the “No Model” data after HP filtering and RETROICOR modelling, or if we need to do both RETROICOR and FAST when TR is sufficiently low. I think the reason for FAST not being able to remove the cardiac peak in figure 3 TR=0,35s is that the cardiac frequency is not constant through time, and that there is considerable spatial variation both in phase and magnitude. At lower TR it makes the noise look like it is white (because it is aliased into a range of frequencies). I also found it a bit puzzling that the area under the yellow curve sometimes look smaller than or equal to those of the the red and green curve, but I guess you might have used normalised residuals, as those outputted from the SPM model estimation, correct?

Hi All,

I am trying to learn about the FAST model for Serial Correlation Correction in SPM.

I have been having some trouble finding resources or documentation describing this model and wondered if anyone could recommend some.

I have found several papers from the last few years showing that the FAST model is better than AR(1) for faster TR's, but I haven't been able to find a detailed explanation for what the fast model does, how it works, or how it's different from AR(1).

The closest I have found to an explanation is from an old JISCmail chain which says that the FAST model "uses a dictionary of covariance
components based upon exponential covariance functions." But I would like to know how it uses that dictionary and more generally understand the method better.

Any suggestions or advice are appreciated.

Thank you!

Cheers,
Brandon

Hello, experts.

I created the seed-based Z map for each subject as a first-level analysis using the Fisher's Z transformation formula using my own matlab script.
Then I want to perform second-level analyses (group analysis like two-sample ttest) using these Zmaps with SPM.
Then, is it OK if I use these Zmaps for the second-level analyses as well as I use the con.nii files which were normally created by the first-level analyses using SPM software without using my own script?

Any advice will be appreciated.

Thank you.

POSTDOC RESEARCH ASSOCIATE ON PROJECT “A TECHNOLOGY TO EXTRACT MEMORIES FROM THE HUMAN BRAIN USING EFIT6 AND THE FRINGE-P3 BRAINWAVE METHOD”

 

School of Psychology and Centre for Human Brain Health, University of Birmingham, UK.

 

The Fringe-P3 method (Bowman et al, 2013; Alsufyani et al, 2019) developed out of a line of theoretical work focussed on temporal attention and perception on the fringe of awareness (Bowman & Wyble, 2007; Avilés et al, 2020; Bowman & Avilés, 2022). The method provides a means to present a large number of visual stimuli very rapidly to a participant’s brain and then determine with EEG, which of those stimuli the participant finds salient. A very simple form of salience that we look at is familiarity, with stimuli that are familiar breaking into participants’ awareness and thereby generating a P3 (or a variant of it), which we detect with EEG. The method has been proposed as a deception detector, specifically, a (countermeasures-resistant) concealed-knowledge test (Bowman et al, 2013, 2014; Alsufyani et al, 2019; Harris et al, 2021).

 

Our recent Innovate UK project with the company Visionmetric (https://visionmetric.com/) provided a prototype system for extracting the memory of a face. This is done by generating a facial morph that is a weighted average of the faces presented in rapid serial visual presentation, with weight determined by the strength of the P3 that face generated. A demo of the system developed in this project can be seen here:

 

https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/hb5/EEGFIT_prototype_demo_cut.mp4

 

The Research Associate will be employed on a recently awarded EPSRC Impact Acceleration account at the University of Birmingham, which, with Visionmetric, will improve the efficiency with which P3s are detected with machine learning and will also explore alternative detection modalities, such as pupil dilation.

 

The position is for one year in the first instance, but with the possibility of follow-on funding.

Dear colleagues,

After doing realignment and unwarp, I want to get the postscript file that includes the information of the head movements (i.e., the line graphs).
While I can get them for some subjects, I cannot for the other subjects.
For all the subjects, I measured the data using the same setting and tried to analyze them using the same parameters.
So far, I cannot find the obvious mistake in my scripts.
I'm using the codes which I got from the SPM batch file for preprocessing(realignment and unwarp, slice timing correction, corregister, and segmentation).

I would be very glad if someone could give me a clue to work this out.

Best regards,

Rui

There will be more local spatial correlations in the 2mm warped data, but whether this has any impact will depend on the assumptions made by the machine learning approach that is applied.  If it assumes i.i.d. noise, then this could cause problems, but if it is some form of kernel approach, then I'd expect all to be fine (although worth double-checking with simulations). If it involves deep learning, then I have no idea what the consequences might be.

When spatially normalising, some regions expand, and some shrink.  This means that you don't have a uniform sampling of the data.  If a region is shrunk during warping, then having 2mm resolution for the warped images would prevent some much information loss in these regions.

Dear Experts,

I have some data which was acquired in low-resolution: 4 mm isotropic. Standard preprocessing would lead to 2mm isotropic images but that seems like a massive amount of upsampling. My goal is to use these images for MVPA - I understand that using a 4mm normalization, rather than 2mm, would be helpful because of lower space requirement and fewer features (so speed). One of the reviewers raises an argument that normalization to 2mm would lead to more correlated voxels which might make an impact on the performance of ML algorithms.

Are there any reasons (other than space/time/convenience) to not upsample to regular 2mm but stick to acquisition voxel size during normalization? Are there papers that have studied the impact of spatial normalization voxel size on fMRI?


Thanks

Hi Daniel,
I am using few toolboxes via SPM GUI. some, such as WFUPickAtlas , Marsbar, ArtRepair, are available in the GUI under "toolbox"
Other toolboxes are avaiable in the GUI batch under the SPM>tools. All folders of these tools are in the SPM folder under "spm12/toolbox"/.

Here is a link to installation manual and how to implement it in SPM: https://www.nitrc.org/projects/clinicaltbx/
Maybe you could find relevnt info for how to implement your tool

hope this helps.

Dear yang

I'll leave the expert's response to Dr Peter zeidman
Nevertheless, I had the same hasitation in my study and i chose the approach you are suggesting - peb of pebs

You can take a look in my paper:

Simultaneous Normalization and Compensatory Changes in Right Hemisphere Connectivity during Aphasia Therapy - PubMed
Changes in brain connectivity during language therapy were examined among participants with aphasia (PWA), aiming to shed light on neural reorganization in the language network. Four PWA with anomia following left hemisphere stroke and eight healthy controls (HC) participated in the study. Two fMRI …

Dear everyone,

I ran into an error message "[GIFTI] Parsing of XML file" during surface reconstruction as part of the segmentation with CAT12.8.2 r2170 / SPM12 r7771 under Matlab R2021a. See below for the complete message (the same for other subjects). Any ideas what this might refer to? As I don't use the default settings, which might possibly have led to the issue, please find the batch at WeTransfer https://we.tl/t-ETAmdM5pQt

Hi all,

I hope to get some advice during the DCM-PEB analysis if I don't want to concatenate multi sessions.

In my project, each subject has six sessions (runs) with identical scans (333 scans of TR = 2s). According to some studies, I should concatenate the sessions, then extract the time series from VOI. However, I am unsure how to add head motion parameters to the first-level GLM. Say the data was preprocessed session-wise, and each session has its head motion parameters, if the six sessions were combined into one session, which head motion parameters should I add?

So I plan to create a DCM for each session and do the PEB-of-PEBs for group analysis. I want to ask your advice if I think correctly as below:

Generally, I will have a 3-level design, first-level: DCM for each run, second-level: PEB for each subject, third-level: PEB for the group.

GCM_subject1 = [DCM_sbuject1run1, DCM_sbuject1run2, ..., DCM_sbuject1run6];
PEB_subject1 = spm_dcm_peb(GCM_subject1, X1); X1 contains six rows of 1, as the mean of this group.

GCM_all = [PEB_subject1,..., PEB_sbuject50]
PEB_all = [GCM_all, X2]; X2 contains one column of mean (i.e. 1) and other columns of covariates.

Do you think this approach is correct, or do you have other suggestions?

Best wishes,
Yang

Dear all,

According to the description of the Toro’s gyrification index (surface ratio) provided in CAT12, it seems that it is computed in a different way than that originally described. After reading the descriptions of both methods, one difference that I spotted is that the original method (described in Toro et al., 2008) calculates gyrification considering the area of the pial surface, while CAT12 calculates it considering the area of the central surface (Gaser et al., 2022). Am I right? Is this the only difference between the two methods?

Thank you.

Hi Guillaume,
I am following up on this message from 2017. It looks like output of processing done using CAT12 misses the mesh geometry information which gives an error. For example, I did 'Threshold and transform spmT surfaces' using CAT12 and the output only has only cdata. The fields faces, vertices etc. are missing. See error below.

SPM12: spm_render (v7577)                          12:51:58 - 14/02/2023

Could anyone help me figure what the issue is, as I did not encounter this with my previous dataset?

Dear Pia

The TE should be chosen to maximise the sensitivity to differences in T2* between oxygenated and deoxygenated haemoglobin. A few milliseconds does not mak a lot of difference, so if that is what it takes to get you an extra slice it might be worth it. But you will loose sensitivity to the BOLD signal if you go to TE=20ms at 3T.

Hi,
Final question, from your experience will you recommend changing the scanning parameters? For example, shorten the TE (it is now TE=30ms), or change other parameters.
I have seen papers that assess these parameters for BOLD, but I do not think any of them was with the new multi-channel coils on the MAGNETOM scanners.
Thank you
 
Pia

Dear Pia
 
You can change the masking threshold (see screenshot). Lower values will give you more voxels, try 0.1 instead of the default 0.8 and use -inf to include all voxels.

Dear SPM community,
We had started to work with a brand new 3T VIDA scanner from Siemens, with an XA31 operating system. We have acquired fMRI data using the 64 channels coil with various acceleration parameters. 
Eyeballing the data there is a massive drop in the signal in deep structures, especially the Putamen. Though it still gives 10 folds more signal than air. When analyzing the data using the default set-up, SPM creates a mask that does include the Putamen.
Any tips, suggestion on how to overcome this problem?
 
Kind regards
 
Pia
