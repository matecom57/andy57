Greetings,
I am having trouble understanding FSL's dtifit V1 file format.

As far as I understand, as a principal eigenvector it defines the vector 
of the fastest diffusion. In V1 this vector is defined by three volumes, 
representing the x/y/z axes. What I don't understand is why values in 
these volumes go into negatives.
I would expect the values to stay positive only, as (from my 
understanding) DTI can only differentiate the axis of diffusion 
(right-left), but not the direction of diffusion (from left to right or 
vice versa).
 
The reason I am asking is because I was trying to create an FA modulated 
V1 RGB image readable by ITK-SNAP. I found here a fix for that that 
required using absolute values of V1 and multiplying these by FA. It 
worked but I am struggling to understand why there are non-absolute values 
in V1 at all.

Best regards,
Stan

Hi Jure,
     Our systems are in the process of being restored, so I would expect 
hopefully by the end of today ( UK time ).

Hi Andreas,

 

how are --field and field_mat specifically used, esp. the mat part?

 

the --field should be a fieldmap, in Hz, with the same FOV as the 
diffusion data. The --field_mat is an optional (FLIRT style) rigid body 
matrix that maps the field onto the diffusion data.

 

I don't really recommend using --field. The problem is that the field you 
pass to eddy needs to be invertible (well, it is the resulting 
displacement field that has to be invertible). This will be true for the 
field you get from topup, but it may not necessarily be true for a dual 
echo-time field. And in particular some of the FSL processing of dual 
echo-time fields in FSL introduces artificial edges at the edge of the 
object, and these edges are effectively singularities.

Hi Matthew,

Thanks for a quick response. Any eta about when servers will be up?

I need the MATLAB/R version because it is used by HCP Pipelines' ICAFix.

Dear Anderson,

after a more extensive search I could find the file design_ekaterina.osd 
within the FSL mailing list. However, it is not clear for me how to
extend the design to three time points per subject. For example, EV1 in 
design 1 is
Subj time EB EV1
1      t1     1   1
1      t2     1  -1

how should I define t3 in EV1? Do I need another EV like
Subj time EB EV1 EV2 EV3
1      t1     1   1      1     0
1      t2     1  -1      0    1
1      t3     1   0      -1   -1

in design 2
Subj time EB EV1 EV2 EV3
1      t1      1   1     0    1
1      t2      1   1     0   -1

how should I define t3 in EV3? Additional EVs like?

Subj time EB EV1 EV2 EV3 EV4 EV5
1      t1      1   1     0    1      1     0
1      t2      1   1     0   -1      0     1
1      t3      1   1     0    0     -1    -1

what would be the correct contrast for an interaction?

Ralf

Dear Saina,

 

My FSL version is 6.0 and I am using eddy_cuda10.2.
Could this be a problem of the version?

 

yes, there were some changes to eddy as part of release 6.0.7.8 that may 
potentially affect you. There is a quite long explanation in the release 
note, but the short story is that the problem described there can 
potentially cause eddy to not estimate and correct for EC and or movement 
accurately. The issue is more likely to appear if you have large 
susceptibility-induced distortions, which is in turn more likely if have a 
long effective readout time and/or if you have a high field scanner (e.g. 
7T).

 

So, I would suggest you first update to the latest version (I think it is 
6.0.7.11), and if you still have problems after that I can take a look at 
your data.

 

Best regards Jesper

Hi Niklas,

 

If there is a more detailed explanation of the -flags and output/input for 
the newest version of eddy, I would very much appreciate a link.

 

the output (format) of eddy is about to change quite a lot. The image 
output will remain much the same as before, but all the text output will 
change. Instead of having individual text files for EC, 
slice-to-vol-movement, outliers etc, they will all be included in a single 
.JSON file. That will also allow me to output more and more detailed 
information that will aid with QC. The "old" text files will still be 
optionally available (and are likely to be for some time) so as not to 
break existing pipelines. These changes are expected to go live with the 
next eddy release. People who use the latest version will have noticed 
that eddy already output a .JSON file, but I still haven't decided on the 
final format so please don't write/base any scripts based on what they 
currently look like.

The documentation is also in the process of being updated accordingly (and 
getting a face lift).

 

Again, my study is not on the brain, it targeted the ankle and the tibial 
nerve with 25 axial slices.

 

I think my concerns are benign, but I just want to check.

 

When running eddy_cuda linked to cuda10.2, I now get several 
EddyInternalGpuUtils: param_update: updates rejected for volume #1 (and 
further volumes, which I assume in my case are slices). Then it refers to 
Levenberg-lamda and writes the mss and then an updated mss.

 

Yes, that was mainly for my own sake to monitor some changes I made to the 
optimisation. If there is anything of genuine concern eddy will terminate. 
Can I just check that you only see those if you specify the --very_verbose 
flag?

 

The end slices of the 25-slices are in many cases empty or corrupt, but in 
some cases it mentions #7, which should not be affected. I also use 
slm=quadratic as I have relatively few gradients and also --resamp=lsr. 
Eddy never halts and the output looks fine and the time for running it is 
similar as before (12 min with one core). Is this something to be 
concerned about?

 

It is unlikely that this indicates a problem. My guess is that it has 
identified slice 7 as an outlier, correctly or not, in some volume. It 
would only be a source of concern if you see the same slice implicated in 
many of the volumes.

I am sure that slm=quadratic is sufficient (it almost always is). Given 
that your object (ankle) is quite small compare to a head, and as long as 
it is placed close to the iso-centre, I would even think that slm=linear 
might be sufficient.

 

Furthermore, there is an bvec-output, bvecs_for_SLR that at least I have 
not observed before. When is this useful and is it associated with any 
particular flags to get is as output?

 

When using SLR you get one output volume per matched pair of input 
volumes. The "bvecs_for_SLR" are the rotated bvecs suitable for use with 
such an output, and the rotation for each pair is the geometric average of 
the two input images.

 

Regarding inputs, is it enough to include the output from topup as input, 
or should one now explicitly set the --field flag as well, assuming it 
refers to the field output of topup? There is also a file field_mat 
mentioned, but I cannot find that file as output from topup, what does 
that file refer to?

 

No, you don't need to worry about those. They are for when you have a 
fieldmap that you have acquired in some other way, i.e. a dual echo-time 
fieldmap.

Hi Stan

 

While it is true that V1 orientations from diffusion MRI don’t have a 
polarity (i.e. could be represented in ½ of the 3D space), this does not 
mean that all the elements of V1 must be positive. If that were the case, 
then the orientations would be confined to one 1/8th of the 3D space.

Dear Paul,

Thank you for your reply. The image screenshot and info I sent in my 
initial email are for the raw unprocessed images. I made copies and ran 
fslswapdim etc. on those while retaining the original files. At least, 
these are the state of the images I received. We received them in DICOM 
format and we converted them to NIFTI as we did with all other images. For 
some reason only these few have this problem but not others.

You mentioned the superior-inferior labels are swapped, might this be 
pertaining to the DTI file (in the AP direction)? What other explanations 
(and possible solutions) could there be?

Many thanks,
Adriana

Dear Anderson,

we investigated 2 groups at 3 different visits (pre, post1 and post2) and 
analyzed the diffusion data with tbss (2x3 design with one between and one 
within factor). We compared the two groups separately for the three visits 
using two sample t-tests and randomise. Now we received the reviews from 
our submisson and one reviewer asked "Were there group differences or a 
time x group interaction for FA, MD?"
After searching the mailing list, I found a link to a exkaterina.ods file 
with the design description of a 2x2 design as a possible reference. 
Unfortunately the link to dropbox is no more valid (this refers also to 
other older .ods files from you with designs). Could you provide the 
exkaternia.ods design again and/or have suggestions to the 2x3 design in 
our study (including contrast setting for the interaction term)?

Dear Miguel,
     I don’t believe “-xthresh” is an existing randomise option ( and may 
throw off the option parser ). If you want to threshold the (1-)pvalue 
outputs you would do this after the randomise call completes ( e.g. to 
isolate significant voxels ).

Hope this helps,

Hi Adriana,

Hi Aldo,

 

To replicate the results from the paper you referenced it would be best to 
use the ROIs used in the paper. Defining protocols to achieve anatomically 
accurate results will take some time and is an iterative process.

 

For visualisation, the colour is simply controlled by what you set it to. 
Different colour maps (hot, cool) can be applied to gain more contrast. 
You can also try adjusting the min and max display ranges.

 

Thanks,

Shaun.

 

Hi,

when I look at V1 BA17 R it seems like the left occipital petalia has

The very same part is chopped off on the left (PNG also attached).

This should be revisited.

Dear Matthew,
Thank you for your detailed explanation! I have a small question about it.
If I understand correctly:
P-value Threshold
Purpose: Identifies statistically significant voxels based on permutation 
tests.
Application: After running the permutation tests, you set a p-value 
threshold (e.g., p < 0.05) to identify statistically significant voxels. 
This initial thresholding helps to focus on voxels that have a high 
likelihood of being truly significant.
Z-value Threshold
Purpose: Standardizes the significant voxels to facilitate comparison and 
interpretability.
Application: Converts significant p-values to Z-values. Applying a Z-value 
threshold (e.g., Z > 3.1) further refines the set of significant voxels, 
ensuring they surpass a certain statistical strength.
In a nutshell, the significant voxel is defined by the p-value from the 
permutation test. In randomise, we can't get a “true” t->p->z conversion, 
so this threshold of 3.1 is not used in defining significant voxels. This 
means changing it to 2.3 will not influence the identification of 
significant voxels. The significant voxel is defined by the p-value from 
the permutation test. The Z value here is just used to compare our results 
to those obtained using parametric methods.
However, what is my cluster probability threshold? Is that set to 0.05 
automatically?
Thank you again for your assistance. Your insights are invaluable in 
helping me grasp the nuances of this analysis.
Kind Regards, 
Yiling

Subject: Re: [FSL] Question about the Feat report page
 
Dear Yiling,
   The “thresh_pstat” image is the (1-)pvalue output from randomise ( the 
naming is a little confusing and comes from shared pipeline elements 
between parametric and non-parametric stats ).  The values in this image 
will be used to determine which voxels are significant and control how the 
next image is clustered: “thresh_zstat” contains the significant, 
cluster-corrected, voxels _but_ the z-values are calculated from the 
per-voxel randomise-derived p-values, to allow easier comparison with 
parametric outputs. The threshold passed into randomise ( 3.1 ) will 
actually be applied to the “raw” t-statistics ( since we are assuming 
non-parametric statistics the “true” t->p->z conversion is unknown ). 
“Thresh_zstat” is the image that will be used in the FEAT report, while 
“cluster_mask_zstat” should just be the discretised cluster-labels for 
thresh_zstat.

When viewing your results, thresh_zstat will probably be the most useful ( 
just remember that some voxels may undershoot the 3.1 t-threshold that 
randomise used ). If you explicitly threshold thresh_pstat at 0.95, then 
the surviving voxels should match those in thresh_zstat.

Hope this all makes sense
Kind Regards
Matthew

    Finally, I looked at cluster_mask_zstat1.nii.gz, it is not the same as

    So I do not understand where my thresholds z=3.1 and p<0.05 applied, 
could you kindly give me some hints on that?

Hello Cesar,

The PCA dimensionality is set by MIGP (see the corresponding paper). In 
this case, the PCA length would be length m=2*T-1, where T is the number 
of timepoints. This is the default behaviour for MIGP. However, you can 
change this with the parameter --migpN, which modifies the "Number of 
internal Eigenmaps".

Best,

Hi,

For the number of samples, you don't need to perform such a calculation. 
It is simply the number of samples per seed voxel. You can start with a 
value of e.g. 5 and increase if the resultant tract is noisy.

From the screenshot, it looks like you're running this using left and 
right seeds and targets combined? I.e. The yellow seed contains left and 
right insula and the target contains both left and right NAC? It will 
likely work better if you separate left and right.

To remove false positives (projections you don't want in your tract) like 
the blue tail, you can add exclusions. Exclude masks delete streamlines 
that pass though the exclusion ROI, thus cleaning up the resultant tract.

Thanks,
Shaun.

Hi Shaun,

Thanks a lot for the email. I was able to run the script but the results 
don't make sense to me. I am using a mask for insula as seed and for

21449 21449.000000 

Then I divided by 1000  ~= 21, I used this value for the file

Insula 21

In the figure that I have attached, there is a blue tail that doesn't make 
sense. The yellow ins the insula ROI, and and green is the NAC.

Could you tell me how can I remove that tail or is normal  that?

tract containing seed/target/exclude masks. Then create a structure file 
with 2 columns (tract name and nsamples).

 

This is detailed fully in the documentation: 
https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/docs/#/diffusion/xtract?id=adding-your-own-tracts

 

You could also use the pre-existing XTRACT tracts as an example, see: 
${FSLDIR}/data/xtract_data/HUMAN where you’ll find protocols for existing 
tracts and the associated structureList file.

 

Thanks,

Shaun.

Hi there,

 

I am trying to create my own tractography using XTRACT, I have used this 
code:

 

My structures.txt file has the following:

ALPFC
Amigdala
FPC
Insula
Putamen

 

and my confi.json:

 

{
  "ALPFC": {
    "name": "ALPFC Tract",
    "seeds": ["ALPFC/AnteriorLateralPrefrontalCortex_v3.nii.gz", 
"Putamen/putamen_mask.nii.gz"],
    "targets": ["ALPFC/roi_NAC.nii.gz"]
  },
  "Amigdala": {
    "name": "Amigdala Tract",
    "seeds": ["Amigdala/roi_basolatera_anygdala.nii.gz", 
"Putamen/putamen_mask.nii.gz"],
    "targets": ["Amigdala/roi_NAC.nii.gz"]
  },
  "FPC": {
    "name": "FPC Tract",
    "seeds": ["FPC/roi_FPC_v4.nii.gz", "Putamen/putamen_mask.nii.gz"],
    "targets": ["FPC/roi_NAC.nii.gz"]
  },
  "Insula": {
    "name": "Insula Tract",
    "seeds": ["Insula/insula_mask.nii.gz", "Putamen/putamen_mask.nii.gz"],
    "targets": ["Insula/roi_NAC.nii.gz"]
  },
  "Putamen": {
    "name": "Putamen Tract",
    "seeds": ["Putamen/putamen_mask.nii.gz", 
"Amigdala/roi_basolatera_anygdala.nii.gz"],
    "targets": ["Putamen/roi_NAC.nii.gz"]
  }  
}

 

xtract -bpx ./diffusion2.bedpostX/ \
       -out ./xtract_attunes_v2/ \
       -species CUSTOM \
       -stdwarp standard2diff_warp.nii.gz diff2standard_warp.nii.gz \
       -p ./custom_xtract_directory/ \
       -stdref 
/home/acamargofb/fsl/data/standard/MNI152_T1_1mm_brain.nii.gz \
       -str ../custom_xtract_directory/structures.txt \
       -gpu

=====================================================

I am getting this error:

                                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~^^^

Does anyone know how to fix this problem ?

Hello

Thanks very much. I tried that and the number of components was exactly 
that number.
However, my question is whether it is possible to estimate a larger 
dimension for the initial dimensionality reduction (PCA) than the number 
of ICs.

Best wishes,
César
