Hi there, I have what is hopefully a basic question about topup.
I have a 4D diffusion file with 9 b=0 images acquired AP interspersed throughout 120 b=500,1000,2000 images. I have extra, separate, 3 b=0 images in PA directions.
When I go to create my AP_PA_b0 file, I will combine the 3x PA b0 images with 3x AP b0 images.
My question is, does it matter which 3 AP b0 images I choose from the 9 that are in the 4D diffusion when I am making this file?
Thanks!

Hi,
I want to extract a mask based on Juelich atlas, considering only voxels that have 50% of belonging to a specific region (amygdala nuclei).
I thought I should do it with the "fslmaths [FILENAME] -thr 50 [OUTPUT_NAME]".
However, I it appears that this command uses some activation threshold that does not 100% overlap with the atlas probabilities.
For example, in the attached screenshot, the probability of being part of the lateralobasal amygdala is 56% and the threshold on the right is 43.  Accordingly, the value in the mask is zero although it is supposed to be 1.

How can I extract a mask BASED ON THE ATLAS PROBABILITIES?

Thank you very much,
Lior

Dear Ben,

 

    Hi there, I have what is hopefully a basic question about topup.

    I have a 4D diffusion file with 9 b=0 images acquired AP interspersed throughout 120 b=500,1000,2000 images. I have extra, separate, 3 b=0 images in PA directions.

    When I go to create my AP_PA_b0 file, I will combine the 3x PA b0 images with 3x AP b0 images.

    My question is, does it matter which 3 AP b0 images I choose from the 9 that are in the 4D diffusion when I am making this file?

 

I tend to recommend running topup with no more than two pairs of images. There is nothing wrong with using more (in your case three pairs, or even 9 vs 3), but my experience is that it doesn’t improve the estimation, while increasing the execution time of topup.

 

The reason I recommend having at least three for each PE-direction is simply to minimise the risk that all of them are “broken”. For example if you only have a single b=0 in the PA direction, and it turns out that the subject moved exactly during the acquisition of that scan. Then it would be “broken”, and if it was the only one you had it would mean that you had nothing to calculate a fieldmap from.

 

Finally, does it matter which you choose?  Yes, it does. You always want to use the first b=0 volume of your full data set (the one where you have the diffusion weighted data) as the first volume in the 4D file that you feed into topup. The reason for that is that the first b=0 volume in the full data set defines that “space” that all other volumes get resampled into. And the first volume in the 4D topup file defines that space that your fieldmap is in. And those two spaces should be the same. If it turns out that the first b=0 volume in your full data set is broken I recommend deleting it, and replacing it with a non-broken one (i.e. one of the other b=0 volumes).

 

I hope that helps.

 

Jesper

Hi Aaron,

If you don't want to create a resampled copy of the input image, just omit the -out option, e.g.:

flirt -in to_transform.nii.gz -ref ref_image.nii.gz -omat transform.mat

If you want to resample the image, but at a different (isotropic) resolution, you can ask flirt to resample the output, e.g.:

flirt -in to_transform.nii.gz -ref ref_image.nii.gz -applyisoxfm 2 -init transform.mat  -out transformed_2mm.nii.gz

Subject: [FSL] Rigid body transform without resampling
 
Hi all,

 I would like to use FSL to perform a rigid body registration between two different modality scans. The following commands register the two images,
```
 flirt -v -in to_transform.nii.gz -ref ref_image.nii.gz -out transformed_image.nii.gz -omat transform.mat
 flirt -v -in to_transform.nii.gz -ref ref_image.nii.gz -out transformed_image.nii.gz -omat transform.mat -init -applyxfm transform.mat
```
However, I do not want to reslice the transformed image into the reference image space, as the input image has a much higher resolution than the reference image. Is there a way to do this using FLIRT/FLS?

Thanks in advance!

Cheers,
Aaron Capon

Hi Sayantan,

Are you running Ubuntu natively, or within a WSL environment? Are you running locally, or over a SSH/X11 connection?

Can you confirm the FSL version by running "cat $FSLDIR/etc/fslversion"?

Can you try experimenting with the GDK_BACKEND and PYOPENGL_PLATFORM environment variables, e.g.:

GDK_BACKEND=x11 fsleyes
PYOPENGL_PLATFORM=egl fsleyes

Could you:

 - make sure you are using the latest version of the fslinstaller.py script (re-download it from https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/)

 - Make sure that rosetta emulation is enabled before running the script - you can do this by running the following command in a terminal:

Applications are open for 11 three-year PhD positions in the German Research Council (DFG) funded program “Neurobiology of Social and Emotional Dysfunctions (GRK 2174)”. The program is interdisciplinary and internationally oriented. Details can be found at
https://www.uni-regensburg.de/research/grk-emotion/application/index.html

Two of these projects (C11 & C12) are looking for candidates with a background in (human) neuroimaging and an interest in combining neuroimaging and machine learning. Project C11 is covering clinical neuroscience aspects whereas project C12 is biased towards basic research and computational neuroscience. Interest in clinical neuroscience, brain imaging, and machine learning/statistical methods are essential. Positions are planned to start between May and July, 2023. The positions are funded for up to three years, according to the German pay scale TV-L E13 (65%).

-------------
Project C11: “Changes in brain communication and cognition in depressive patients who undergo electroconvulsive therapy”
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a severe mental disorder that is estimated to affect as many as one in five adults during their lifetime. 15-30% of MDD patients have a treatment resistant depression, i.e. they do not show a clinical response to two successive antidepressant (psychological or pharmacological) interventions of adequate dose and duration. One of the most effective options to treat treatment resistant depression is electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), in which a series of brief seizures is intentionally triggered by electrical stimulation of the brain under general anesthesia.
In this project we follow patients throughout ECT treatment compared to patients receiving treatment as usual (TAU) and regularly assess cognitive and affective parameters using behavioral testing as well as biomarkers for brain communication using functional magnetic resonance imaging and blood sampling. We use machine learning methods to characterize patients in terms of cognition, affect and brain communication and to predict their responses to ECT. The PhD candidate will interact with the patients, and will be involved in acquiring, analyzing and interpreting behavioral and imaging data and developing prediction models. The lab’s language is English, but in project C11 interacting with patients requires the ability to converse on a good level in German.

Project C12: “Brain Representations of Emotional States in Humans”
There are many ways to feel happy, sad, angry, or surprised. Is there a way to identify such emotional states reliably from brain activity? The Biomedical Imaging Group at the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at the University of Regensburg works on developing brain-based biomarkers of emotions for basic as well as clinical research on emotion and emotion related disorders.
In this project we aim at inducing emotional states and investigating the resulting patterns of brain activity in terms of classification and individualized representational aspects using machine learning approaches such as statistical classifiers, deep neural networks and representational similarity analysis.
We are looking for a PhD candidate from Psychology, Computer Science, Physics, Mathematics, or related fields, preferably with a strong background in computational (neuro-)science.

Dear colleagues,

The Signal Processing in Neuroimaging research group at the BCBL is looking for a motivated postdoctoral researcher in the development of a neuroimaging platform using fNIRS and fMRI for the rapid computation (i.e., on-the-fly or in real-time) of cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) maps. The ideal candidate would have excellent programming skills using Python and/or Matlab and proven experience in the preprocessing and analysis of fMRI and/or fNIRS data. Of particular interest to the research group is the latest evolution of fNIRS towards wearable and high-density systems, hence familiarity with instruments and methods for diffuse optical tomography (DOT) are considered a plus. Preference will be given to candidates with prior experience in real-time biomedical signal processing or neuroimaging applications (e.g., neurofeedback, brain-computer interfaces). In addition, the selected candidate will have the opportunity to develop original experiments under the supervision and guidance of the PIs, as well as participate in the supervision of undergraduate and doctoral students. The selected candidate will also have the opportunity to integrate into other projects of the group and pursue collaborations within the team, the BCBL, as well as our international collaborators. The SPIN BCBL provides an inclusive and supportive environment with plenty of opportunities for career growth, scientific and cultural curiosity, and community involvement, depending on the candidate's skills and aspirations. We welcome all applicants. 

More information about the position and the project is available at:

Hi everyone,

I created a contrast in the GLM GUI and it has the following information:

EV1 = G2 pre
EV2 = G2 post
EV3 = G1 pre
EV4 = G1 post
EV5 = Age
EV6 = MoCA

Contrast Title                EV1    EV2    EV3    EV4    EV5     EV6  
G1post < G2 post.          0         1       0       -1       0         0

My question is... does inputting 0 into EV1 and EV3 control for the pre- (baseline) for both G1 and G2?

Hope to hear back soon!

Best,
Ryu

Can one assume that the waytotal is an estimate of total fibers entering the termination mask and hence provide useful information?  I know it's probabilistic.  

Is there a way of getting fiber dispersion values entering the termination mask?

If a streamline enters more than one voxel in your waypoint/termination mask, it will be counted more than once in the fdt_paths, but only once in the waytotal file.

Dear FSL developers and users,

 

What does waytotal output of protrackx exactly represent?

 

I use this command:

 

probtrackx --mode=seedmask -x seed --stop=termination --waypoints=termination ....

 

note that --stop and --waypoints files are the same file because I am looking for only fibers that end at the termination region.

 

After I get the tract, I expect I can intersect it with the termination mask to see fibers entering the termination region. I expect the total count of pixel values within is the number of tracts that reached termination. In my case, it adds up to 3399, but the waytotal file has 3370. Why the small discrepancy? Why do they differ?

 

Thank you,

Hi Lin,

The "expanded functional image" option will cause a three-stage registration to take place (functional -> expanded functional -> structural). This option is useful for partial-FOV data, where one full-FOV volume has been acquired.

The "alternative reference image" option will result in two-stage registration, using the alternative reference in place of the functional data. This option should only be used if the alternative reference is defined in the same space as the functional data.

I am doing registration for multiband func data and have found 2 different ways to add a high-contrast alternative reference volume:

 

One is on the Registration practical of the MRI course, which uploaded the image to ‘registration’ -> ‘Expanded functional image’
Another one is in the ICA practical of the MRI course, which used ‘Pre-stat’  ‘Alternative reference image’.
 

I may misunderstood but they look the same to me. I had a test run for both methods, however had the registration a little bit different.

 

Please can you suggest?

On my machine running Ubuntu 20.04 Focal Fossa I have an Nvidia Unix x86-64 kernel module (cat /proc/driver/Nvidia/version) with Cuda version 10.1.243. 8 am using the fsl-built gcc (${FSLDIR}/bin/gcc)

Hi Alessandra and Kiyotaka,

The FSL wiki GPU page is out of date. As of FSL 6.0.6, you do not need to install the CUDA toolkit to run eddy_cuda (the 10.2 toolkit is statically linked into the binary) - you only need to install a CUDA driver.

Alessandra, are you running eddy_cuda directly, or are you submitting it to a cluster via fsl_sub?

Dear Alessandra,

In order to use eddy_cuda10.2 in Ubuntu 20.04, you need to install CUDA 10.2.

The trick is that you need to use Ubuntu 18.04 repository for CUDA (not Ubuntu 20.04 repository)

Attached is a script which installs CUDA 10.2 for Ubuntu 20.04.

I myself use Ubuntu 20.04 and I wrote this script for myself.

Save this script in Download and run this script sets up NVIDIA repository and install CUDA 10.2.

After reboot, you can use eddy_cuda 10.2.

Hope this helps,

Kiyotaka

I found these information at
https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/GPU

according to which, it seems that eddy_cuda is not supported by the 10.02 cuda suite!

How could I install a cuda (9.1 or 8.0) that instead supports it?

Thanks,

Alessandra Stella

Dear Matthew,
sorry for the delay of my answer,
I will send you the photo of the screen, It's in italian
The pc crashes when fsl is ultimating the installation, specifically when it's 100%.
I'm trying to install fsl for ubuntu20 on a ubuntu22 environment.
Thank you very much for the support
Sincerely
Alberto

Hi Alberto,
If you could send a screenshot/photo of the Blue Screen that would be great. How long does the installer run for before the crash - e.g. does it crash instantly or run for some time?

Kind Regards
Matthew

Hi Alberto,
Can you take a screenshot/photo of the Blue Screen error? Can you also confirm how much RAM your machine has?

Kind Regards

Hi everyone,
I have a problem with installing fsl.
I would install it from WSL, I followed instructions on the fsl page, all passages are completed but during the processing of the command "python /mnt/c/Users/<WindowsUserName>/Downloads/fslinstaller.py" , the blue screen appears with a system error every time.
Does my pc (Dell Latitude 7490) not support fsl requirements?
Thank you in advance

Hi SPM people,

I recently implemented an excellent package for Mapper analysis (from Topological Data Analysis) on neuroimaging data. I'm sure it will have a larger audience if I integrate it into SPM12.

Is there any documentation on how to create a new toolbox in SPM? If not, can you point me to some simple toolboxes that I can use as an example? Preferably something using GUIs for picking configurations. 

Best,
Daniel Hasegan
